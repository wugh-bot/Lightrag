Referees comments are noted in writing on the Reference Check form.
Best practice recommends that all recruits to the organisation have at least two referee checks conducted.  At least one of these referees must be a current or previous direct manager or supervisor of the recruit.  The referee needs to be credentialed by Anthem’s HR/Personnel department or Manager responsible for HR and the referee themselves. The referee should be contacted through their workplace reception and not a mobile number (where possible). 

Police Checks
A National Police Certificate is required for all employees and volunteers and must be arranged by the applicant as per their employment/enterprise agreement.  
Our organisation follows the Police Certificate Guidelines for Aged Care Providers underpinned by the Accountability and Record Principles 2014 and Aged Care Act 1997 for all workers. The following principles apply:
Police certificates, not more than three years old, must be held by:
all staff members who are reasonably likely to have access to residents, whether supervised or unsupervised and
Volunteers who have unsupervised access to residents.
Anthem must not allow a person to become a staff member or a volunteer unless satisfied that:
the police certificate does not record that the person has been:
convicted of murder or sexual assault; or
convicted of, and sentenced to imprisonment for, any other form of assault; and
if the person has been, at any time after turning 16, a citizen or permanent resident of a country other than Australia—the person has made a statutory declaration stating that the person has never been:
convicted of murder or sexual assault; or
convicted of, and sentenced to imprisonment for, any other form of assault.

Staff includes:
key personnel of our organisation (see below for further details regarding requirements for ‘key personnel’)
employees and contractors of our organisation who provide care to residents, this includes all staff employed, hired, retained or contracted to provide services under the control of our organisation whether in a community setting or in the resident’s own home
allied health professionals contracted by us to provide care to residents
kitchen, cleaning, laundry, garden and office personnel employed by us either directly or through a contract agency and
consultants, trainers and advisors for accreditation support or systems improvement who are under the control of our organisation.
volunteers
People who are not considered ‘staff’ include:
visiting medical practitioners, pharmacists and other allied health professionals who have been requested by, or on behalf of, a resident but are not contracted by us and
trades people who perform work at the request of the resident and other than under the control of our organisation (that is, independent contractors). For example, plumbers, electricians or delivery people who are utilised on an ‘ad hoc’ basis.
Contractors (including any services that are brokered by Anthem to other individuals or organisations) also require police checks and any contracts with these individuals or organisations include a requirement for them to provide us with evidence of a police check register.
New staff members are required to have a current police certificate but may commence work before receiving a police certificate if:
the care or other service to be provided by the person is essential and, in this circumstance,
an application for a police certificate has been made before the date on which the person first becomes a staff member or volunteer and
until the police certificate is obtained, the person is subject to appropriate and documented supervision during the periods where the person has any access to residents and
the person makes a Statutory Declaration stating that they have never been:
convicted of murder or sexual assault or
convicted of, and sentenced to imprisonment for, any other form of assault.
The HR Manager completes Employment Checks Register.  The Police Certificate is copied and filed (with the employee’s written and recorded permission) in the employee’s file in line with record keeping principles. 
If the applicant has committed an offence the nature of the offence, the penalty and when it occurred are considered by the selection panel before proceeding with the Offer of Employment.  A previous conviction does not necessarily disqualify a person from employment with our organisation unless it is a conviction for murder, sexual assault or other assault.  However, in these circumstances, a formal and recorded assessment will be made against the information in the Police Check against the position responsibilities in terms of risk to the organisation and residents. 
Three months prior to the police check expiring, each staff member or volunteer is advised that a new police certificate is required.  When staff provide the updated certificate the information in the Employment Checks Register is updated.  
If staff do not provide an updated police certificate before the expiration of the existing certificate, they will not be permitted to work until a valid police certificate is obtained.  
Staff and volunteers are required to advise the HR Manager if they are convicted of a precluding offence in the three-year period between obtaining and renewing their police clearance.  
If we are satisfied on reasonable grounds that a staff member or volunteer has been convicted of a precluding offence the person will not continue as a staff member or volunteer

Anthem is required to take reasonable steps to ensure that no key personnel are disqualified individuals. 
Key personnel include: the Governing Body; any person who is responsible for executive decisions; the person/s responsible for the day to day operations of the organisation and the person responsible for overseeing nursing services (if applicable).
