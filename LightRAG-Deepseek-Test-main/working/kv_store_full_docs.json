They should be used in conjunction with the professional practice framework developed and required by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia for all nurses.\nThe project to revise the existing Australian Nursing Federation [ANF] \nCompetency Standards for \nnurses in general practice  was funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and \nmanaged by the ANMF. Our research partner in this project was the University of Wollongong.A project team from the ANMF and the University of Wollongong, led by Julianne Bryce, Senior \nFederal Professional Officer and lead researcher Dr Elizabeth Halcomb, Professor of Primary Health Care Nursing, undertook the development of the new national Standards.\nThis project would not have been possible without the generous contribution of the hundreds of \nnurses who participated in the underpinning research and the review and validation of the draft Standards.\nWe encourage all nurses in General Practice to use these new national Standards to work to \ntheir full scope of practice in this rapidly growing health care setting for the betterment of the Australian community.\nLee Thomas\nFederal Secretary\nAustralian Nursing and Midwifery Federation\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice2\nGlossary \nCompetence “The combination of skills, knowledge, attitudes, values \nand abilities that underpin effective and/or superior performance in a profession”\n[1, p.10). Competence \n“encompasses both confidence and capability”(2, p.16).\nCompetence assessment “Assessment of an individual’s competence may occur through structured educational programs or a peer review process”\n(2, p.16). “Evidence of a person’s competence  \nmay include:\n• written transcripts of the skills/knowledge they have \nobtained in a formal course\n• their in-service education session records\n• direct observation of their skill\n• questioning/clarification of their knowledge base\n• evaluation of planned care which includes the consumer’s perspective using agreed criteria\n• self-assessment through reflection on performance in  comparison with professional standards”\n(2, p.16).\nConsumer The term consumer may refer to either individuals, groups or communities such as patients, residents and/or their families/representatives/significant others “who work in partnership with nurses to plan and receive nursing  care”\n(2, p.16). The term client is often used interchangeably \nwith ‘consumer’.\nDecision-making framework The national decision making framework is a set of tools and principles to assist nurses in the process of making decisions about whether specific tasks are within their individual scope of practice\n(2). It also provides a framework \nfor nurses seeking to expand their individual scope of practice. “Differences in the education, experience and competence of the individual, and in the context in which they practise, are considered in using the template  tools” \n(2, p.4). \nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice3\nDelegation / Delegate “A delegation relationship exists when the registered \nnurse, as a member of the multidisciplinary health care team, delegates aspects of nursing care, which they are competent to perform and which they would normally perform themselves, to another member of the health care team”\n(2, p. 17).\nDelegations are made by the registered nurse following an assessment that will identify the care activities “to meet consumers’ needs and to ensure access to health care services — that is, the right person is available at the right time to provide the right service to a consumer”\n(2, p. 17). The \nregistered nurse “retains accountability for the decision to delegate and for monitoring outcomes”\n(2, p. 17).\nDelegation by the registered nurse is a two-way, multi-level activity, requiring a rational decision-making and risk assessment process. The end point of delegation may come only after assessment that the person to whom the task is delegated has appropriate clinical competence. Delegation is different from allocation or assignment which involves asking another person to care for one or more consumers on the assumption that the required activities of consumer care are normally within that person’s responsibility and scope of practice. Many of the same factors regarding competence assessment and supervision that are relevant to delegation also need to be considered in relation to allocation/assignment.\nEnrolled nurse The enrolled nurse is Australia’s second level nurse and works under the direction and supervision of the registered nurse. Within this context, the enrolled nurse “demonstrates competence in the provision of person-centred care as specified by the registering authority’s licence to practise, educational preparation and context of care. At all times, the enrolled nurse retains responsibility for his/her actions and remains accountable in providing delegated nursing care”\n(3, p.2). Enrolled nurses in Australia \nare prepared at a Diploma level (or equivalent).\nEvidence-based practice Evidence based practice “is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients”\n(4, p.71). It involves \ncombining the best available research evidence with clinician judgement and consumer preferences.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice4\nGeneral practice team The general practice team is a group of health professionals \nand support staff with complementary skills who deliver primary care services. Typically in General Practice this includes: registered nurses, nurse practitioners, enrolled nurses, general practitioners, allied health professionals, practice managers, medical receptionists and cleaning staff.\nLocal community The term ‘local community’ is used in this document to refer to the individuals living in proximity to the General Practice. Whilst in urban areas this may be quite a small area, in rural or remote regions the geographical size of this community will increase.\nNurse practitioner “A nurse whose registration has been endorsed by the NMBA as a nurse practitioner under Section 95 of the National Law. A nurse practitioner is a registered nurse who is educated and endorsed to function autonomously and collaboratively in an advanced and extended clinical role. The nurse practitioner role includes assessment and management using advanced nursing knowledge and skills. The role may include, but is not limited to, the direct referral of patients to other health professionals, prescribing medications and ordering diagnostic investigations”\n(5). Nurse practitioners in Australia are \nprepared for endorsement at a Masters Degree level.\nNursing assessment The systematic collection of information by a nurse from a consumer to determine their current health status and care needs. This may include, but is not limited to consumer interviews, physical assessments and diagnostic tests. \nPopulation health “Population health is focused on understanding health and disease in the community, and on improving health and well-being through priority health approaches addressing the disparities in health status between social groups”\n(6).\nPractice community The term Practice community is used in this document to refer to the individuals who seek services from the General Practice.\nPractice manager A staff member employed within a General Practice for the purposes of managing the business aspects of the Practice. These include but are not limited to “financial management, human resource management, planning and marketing, information management, risk management, governance and organisational dynamics, business and clinical operations”\n(7). Whilst some individuals employed as \na practice manager may have a clinical background, where the term ‘practice manager’ is used in this document this refers to the work undertaken within a non-clinical role.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice5\nPrimary health care \norganisations/networksPrimary health care organisations/networks are local organisations that are funded to co-ordinate the delivery of primary care and community based services within a defined geographical area. Primary health care organisations are responsible for population health planning and the delivery of integrated primary care services to meet local community needs. In doing this they support disease prevention, health promotion, the delivery of multi-disciplinary care and seek to address health inequities. In Australia these organisations have been previously known as Divisions of General Practice or Medicare Locals.\nRegistered nurse “The registered nurse demonstrates competence in the provision of nursing care as specified by registration requirements, Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia [NMBA] standards and codes, educational preparation, relevant legislation and context of care. The registered nurse practises independently and interdependently, assuming accountability and responsibility for their own actions and delegation of care to enrolled nurses and health care workers”\n(1, p.1). Registered nurses in Australia are \nprepared at a Bachelor Degree level.\nRegistered nurse  (advanced practice)The NMBA\n(8) defines advanced practice as “a level of nursing \npractice that uses comprehensive skills, experience and knowledge in nursing care”\n(8, p. 1). Nurses practicing at this \nlevel demonstrate “critical analysis, problem solving and accurate decision-making”\n(8, p. 1). Registered nurses working \nat an advanced practice level are regularly undertaking work of high complexity and may work in either a specialist or generalist capacity. Advanced nursing practice “may not purely be confined to clinical work”\n(8, p. 3).\nIt is essential that the individual “registered nurse is clinically and educationally prepared to perform at those levels”\n(8, p.3). The NMBA(8) supports the view that advanced \npractice nurses “are educationally prepared at Masters level”\n(p. 1). \nScope of practice “A profession’s scope of practice is the full spectrum of roles, functions, responsibilities, activities and decision-making capacity that individuals within that profession are educated, competent and authorised to perform”\n(2, p.1).\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice6\nSupervision “There are three types of supervision in a practice context:\n1. managerial supervision involving performance \nappraisal, rostering, staffing mix, orientation, induction, team leadership etc.\n2. professional supervision where, for example, a [nurse] preceptors a student undertaking a [pre-registration] course, or a registered nurse supports and supervises the practice of an enrolled nurse\n3. clinically-focussed supervision, as part of delegation.\nIn relation to consumer care activities delegated to another person by a registered nurse from a nursing plan of care, clinically-focused supervision includes providing education, guidance and support for individuals who are performing the delegated activity, directing the individual’s performance and monitoring and evaluating outcomes, especially the consumer’s response to the activity”\n(2, p.19).\nSupervision of an enrolled nurse by a registered nurse may be either direct or indirect supervision.\nDirect supervision A model of clinical supervision where the registered nurse “is actually present and personally observes, works with, guides and directs” the enrolled nurse who is being supervised\n(2, p.19).\nIndirect supervision A model of clinical supervision where the registered nurse “works in the same facility or organisation as the supervised” enrolled nurse, “but does not constantly observe their activities”. The registered nurse “must be available for reasonable access. What is reasonable will depend on the context, the needs of the consumer and the needs of the enrolled nurse who is being supervised”\n(2, p.19).\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice7\nAbbreviations\nANMF Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation\nEN Enrolled Nurse\nGP General Practitioner\nIT Information Technology\nNMBA Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia\nRN Registered Nurse\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice8\nINTRODUCTION\nOverview\nThe nature of healthcare is changing internationally. Health systems are undergoing a range of \nreforms in an attempt to enhance integration of care and facilitate connected service provision between health care providers. As part of this reform there is a mandate for health professionals to increase their involvement in health promotion activities and in early intervention to slow the progression of chronic disease\n(9). To achieve this there is a growing emphasis on building strong \nprimary care systems to provide both preventative health care and ongoing chronic disease management\n(10-13).\nEvidence suggests that health systems are best operated by teams of multidisciplinary health professionals working together to provide integrated health care\n(14). To facilitate integration \nbetween team members and optimise the distribution of care provision across the team, it is important that all team members have an awareness of the scope of practice and competence of each of the professions that comprise the team\n(12, 13, 15, 16). Role confusion and role ambiguity \nhave both been identified as key barriers to interprofessional collaboration(13, 17). Additionally, it is \nimportant that information about the roles of various health professionals is clearly conveyed to health care consumers to improve their access to, and interactions with, health services\n(11, 18).\nOver the last fifty years, the roles of various professions within the health care system have transformed dramatically\n(20). New specialities have emerged, specialist and advanced roles have \nbeen introduced and the scope of practice of some professionals has changed(20). This has created \na need to explore and redefine the professional boundaries and scope of practice for all health professionals.\nNurses are integral to the provision of safe, efficient and high quality primary care\n(20) and are \nkey to the delivery of the agenda for strengthening primary care services(15, 22-24). Despite the \ngrowing employment of nurses in General Practice both in Australia and internationally, the \npotential role and scope of practice of nurses in this setting remains poorly understood(12, 19). \nNational competency standards for registered nurses(1) and enrolled nurses(3) are set by the \nNursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) as base standards which define the levels of safe and competent practice that all nurses must meet when providing nursing services\n(25). These \nAustralian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) National Practice Standards for Nurses in \ngeneral practice  have been developed to accompany the NMBA standards and describe aspects \nof the professional practice of nurses’ specific to General Practice settings. This document supersedes the previous Australian Nursing Federation \nCompetency Standards for nurses in \ngeneral practice[25).\nThese Standards are specifically focussed on the registered nurse and enrolled nurse workforcein Australian General Practice. It is acknowledged that further work is required to clearly articulate the scope of practice of other practitioners such as nurse practitioners, midwives, Aboriginal health care workers and unregulated workers (for example, assistants in nursing or health care assistants) in the general practice setting. Additionally, some other groups of primary health care nurses who are working outside General Practice are yet to have professional practice standards developed specifically for their clinical setting. Despite its importance, that work is beyond the scope of this project.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice9\nAustralian General Practice\nGeneral practice is usually the first point of contact with the Australian health care system for \nindividuals across the lifespan(26). As such it not only provides a diverse range of primary care \nservices, but also acts as an entry point and referral portal to other providers within the health care system. The ageing population and rise in chronic and complex disease is necessitating the development of robust primary care systems to provide a combination of preventative health care and ongoing chronic disease management\n(10-13). The strengthening of the general practice nursing \nworkforce has been a key strategy to improve access to services and enhance the delivery of evidence-based primary care.\nAround 85% of Australians receive at least one general practice service each year\n(26). The number \nof consultations per head of population has risen from 4.9 in 2001 to 5.6 in 2012-13(26). Unlike \nthe situation internationally, Australian consumers are able to visit the General Practice of their \nchoice and can see various health professionals from multiple Practices to receive services(27). \nThis has implications for the planning and delivery of primary health care initiatives as Practice population profiles are not discrete.\nIn 2011-12 Australia had around 10,693 nurses\n(28) and 25,056 general practitioners (GPs)(29) \nworking in General Practice. The numbers of nurses employed in Australian General Practice \nhas risen exponentially in recent years as a result of a positive policy environment and enhanced funding of nursing services\n(10). Between 2003 and 2012, the percentage of General Practices \nemploying a nurse rose from 40%(30) to 63.3%(28). However, this rapid workforce growth has \noccurred in a somewhat ad hoc manner as a response to various funding schemes, rather than being a carefully planned workforce development\n(31). This has raised a number of challenges for \nthe nursing profession around the role of the nurse in General Practice, the nurse’s scope of practice and continuing professional development opportunities\n(32). \nFunding for Australian General Practice services is predominately a fee-for-service model, with Practices operating as small businesses or within larger corporate chains. Whilst the national universal medical insurance scheme (Medicare) provides remuneration to the Practice for each item of service, increasingly, consumers are being required to pay a gap fee to the Practice. In 2011-12, almost $5.6 billion dollars was spent by the Federal Government on services provided by doctors and nurses in General Practice\n(33). \nPrior to 2012, the Medicare Benefits Schedule provided specific item numbers for the delivery of nursing services such as cervical smears, immunisations and wound care, provided ‘for and on behalf of’ a general practitioner. For each occasion of nursing service, remuneration was provided to the Practice from Medicare. This funding model significantly impacted on the services that were delivered by nurses in General Practice\n(34). On January 1 2012 the Practice \nNurse Incentive Program was implemented(35). This program provides incentive payments to \naccredited General Practices to offset the employment of a nurse(35). The amount of incentive \npayment received by a Practice is based on its Standardised Whole Patient Equivalent value and the number of hours worked by nurses\n(35). This incentive aims to support an “enhanced \nrole for nurses working in General Practice”[35, p.3] as it is not tied to the delivery of any specific \nservices(35, p.3). These ANMF National Practice Standards for Nurses in general practice  will \nassist in highlighting the potential scope of practice for a nurse employed in General Practice for employers and practice managers.\nThe model of care within a specific General Practice is dependent on a range of complex factors \nincluding the size and clinical focus of the practice, the range of health professionals employed and their skill mix, the needs of the Practice population, the business model, available funding incentives and the individual preferences of the Practice owners. The small/medium business model of General Practice means that there is considerable variation in service provision and availability between Practices. Regardless of the specific foci of an individual Practice, these professional practice Standards provide a generic best practice framework for the role of the nurse in the General Practice setting. \nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice10\nWhat can a nurse do in general practice?\nThe NMBA defines the scope of practice of a profession as the “full spectrum of roles, \nfunctions, responsibilities, activities and decision-making capacity that individuals within that profession are educated, competent and authorised to perform”\n (36, p.1, 37). Not all elements \nwithin a scope of practice are unique to a specific profession, with elements of service delivery potentially overlapping\n(37). Additionally, external factors such as the environment, including \nlegislation, policy, education, standards, the specific clinical setting and population health needs will influence the scope of practice\n(37). The scope of practice of an individual nurse may \nbe more specifically defined to reflect the individual nurse’s “education, clinical experience and demonstrated competency”\n(18, p. 47)in the specific clinical setting(16, 18). The NMBA has developed \na national decision making framework(37) to guide nurses’ in making decisions about whether a \nparticular aspect of care or service delivery is within their individual scope of practice.\nWhat are professional practice standards?\nProfessional practice standards, such as this document, provide an opportunity for the profession to more clearly articulate the scope of practice of a nurse in a particular clinical setting or when providing care for a defined consumer group\n(38). Professional practice standards can serve a \nvariety of purposes. A key purpose of these Standards is communicating the scope of nursing practice to others within the nursing profession, other health professionals, and stakeholders such as employers and consumers\n(39-41). To this end, they also inform organisational policy about \nthe nurses’ scope of practice. Standards provide a framework for tertiary institutions and other education providers to develop curricula and assess student performance\n(1, 11, 38), as well as acting \nas a tool to assess an individual’s competence to practice either as part of regular renewals of registration, after breaks in service or in professional conduct matters\n(1). \nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice11\nComplexity of practice in general practice\nAn important issue raised in the contemporary environment of primary care is that the nursing \nrole in primary care generally, and more specifically in General Practice, is very broad(42). It \nextends from working with people to address acute health issues to managing chronic and complex disease, population health initiatives and undertaking health promotion and disease prevention activities\n(42). The role of the nurse will vary based on a range of factors including the \nGeneral Practice profile, Practice structure and individual employment arrangements. As such, the clinical skill set and associated knowledge base are necessarily broad and wide reaching. This presents a significant challenge in terms of defining core standards of practice for this area of practice. Oandasan et al.\n(13) describe the “specialised generalist” knowledge of the Canadian \nfamily practice nurse being similar to that of family physicians who are well recognised as a distinct medical specialty. To this end the General Practice Foundation\n(41) identify that it is \nessential for all nurses working in General Practice to “achieve and maintain a minimum level of competency across all areas of the generalist role”\n(41, p. 4), despite any particular expertise in \nspecialist areas of practice. This document outlines the generalist standards expected of nurses working in General Practice. Nurses who provide specialist care within the general practice setting, for example those working as sexual health nurses, diabetes educators, or mental health nurses, would be expected to have the educational preparation to achieve the relevant standards for practice in these clinical areas, in addition to the general standards for all registered nurses and those for nurses in General Practice.\nRegistered nurses and enrolled nurses\nIn Australian General Practice, registered nurses and enrolled nurses work together in complementary roles within the nursing team. Whilst all nurses are accountable for their own individual practice\n(1, 3), the NMBA require that the enrolled nurse’s practice is supervised \nby a registered nurse(1, 3). This supervision arrangement is required regardless of whether a \ngeneral practitioner is in attendance. Having a named registered nurse to provide supervision and appropriate delegation of nursing care is essential to both meeting the requirements of practice and maintaining patient safety. The level of supervision required for enrolled nurse practice is dependent on a range of factors, including the knowledge, skills and competence of the individual enrolled nurse, the acuity of the patient and the nature and complexity of the care being provided\n(25). Supervision of the enrolled nurse by the registered nurse can either be direct, \nwhere the registered nurse is physically present and works together with the enrolled nurse, or indirect where the registered nurse is readily contactable during the enrolled nurse’s working hours but does not directly observe the care as it is being provided\n(25). It is recommended that \na combination of direct and indirect supervision be used to provide opportunities for registered nurses and enrolled nurses to regularly communicate and work together.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice12\nPerformance review\nReview of an individual’s performance in the workplace is an important tool in professional \ndevelopment, identifying learning needs, cultivating relationships between managers and staff and identifying career development opportunities\n(43, 44). Most importantly, however, peer \nperformance review is a key strategy to ensure the delivery of high quality nursing care(44). There \nis some complexity in review of performance in General Practice given the multidisciplinary nature of the workforce and the complicated employee-employer relationships within the general practice team\n(45, 46). \nA nurse’s performance can be separated into two discrete areas, namely; clinical and organisational. \nClinical performance relates to the way in which the individual enacts the nursing \nrole within their employment. Given the need for professional and clinical understanding of the relevant issues and performance requirements, assessment of the clinical performance of a registered nurse or enrolled nurse can only be undertaken by an experienced registered nurse. This peer review is an organised process in which a professional evaluates the quality and appropriateness of care delivered by their peers\n(44). Review of a nurse’s clinical performance may \nbe undertaken annually as part of a scheduled performance review process, ad hoc in response to a report of poor practice or as a process of regular quality assurance and professional development\n(47). Templates and tools have been developed to guide these types of peer evaluation \n(available on the ANMF website).\nOrganisational performance , on the other hand, relates to the way in which the individual \ncontributes to the workplace as an employee(47). This may include aspects such as: personal \npresentation, communication, completion of assigned tasks, adherence to organisational policies and procedures. Review of this aspect of performance can be undertaken either by the experienced registered nurse or, where appropriate, by the practice manager or practice principal.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice13\nTHE PRACTICE STANDARDS FOR \nNURSES IN GENERAL PRACTICE\nOverview\nAll nurses working in Australia must meet the national registration standards defined by the NMBA\n(1, 3), as well as the range of professional codes, standards and guidelines relevant to \nnursing practice and nursing in General Practice. These ANMF National practice standards \nfor nurses in general practice , build on the NMBA foundational documents to be included in \nthe professional practice framework for nurses working within the Australian general practice setting.\nThe core professional Standards for the registered nurse and enrolled nurse in this document \nreflect the Bachelor of Nursing and the Diploma of Nursing as the minimum education qualifications for nurses, respectively\n(1, 3). Therefore, the registered nurse and enrolled nurse \nstandards describe the minimum level at which a registered nurse or enrolled nurse would be expected to practice. It is recognised that many registered nurses in General Practice are working at, or have the capacity to work at, a higher level than the minimum standard for registered nurses. To this end, the registered nurse (advanced practice) performance indicators build upon the knowledge and skills of the minimum standard for registered nurses to provide both a measure of higher level practice and also a framework to guide professional development. It is anticipated that most experienced registered nurses will meet a combination of registered nurse and registered nurse (advanced practice) indicators across standards based on their individual nursing experience, continuing professional development and post-graduate education. Registered nurse (advanced practice) performance indicators that are not yet met will assist the registered nurse in identifying potential areas for future continuing professional development and/or post-graduate education. \nEnrolled nurses seeking to practice beyond the scope of the performance indicators in these \nStandards are encouraged to seek professional development opportunities to facilitate their transition to formal university education. Without the completion of a Bachelor of Nursing (or equivalent) the enrolled nurses’ practice is limited to their educational preparation in accordance with their registration to practise as an enrolled nurse with the NMBA.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice14\nDevelopment of these Standards\nCompetency standards for nurses in Australian General Practice were originally developed \nduring 2004(25). These ANMF National practice standards for nurses in general practice  were \ndeveloped during 2013-14 using a process of critical reflection on the existing Standards and investigation of contemporary nursing in the Australian general practice setting. Data were collected using a mixed methods approach. A series of fourteen focus groups were held across Australia in a range of rural and metropolitan locations and at two national professional conferences. Over 200 individuals attended these sessions to provide their input. To augment these qualitative data and inform the development of the revised Standards, two national  on-line modified Delphi surveys were conducted. The first survey, conducted from 25 February - 21 March 2014, received 263 responses. The second survey, conducted from 29 July – 25 August 2014, received 298 responses. In addition, individual telephone interviews and email consultations were undertaken with individuals from key stakeholder groups. Participants in the data collection included nurses, practice managers, general practitioners, Medicare local staff, nurse academics, allied health professionals and representatives of key stakeholder groups. This project was supported by both a Project Advisory Group (Appendix A) and a Project Reference Group (Appendix B) who provided expert input to both the research component and the development of the Standards. Validation of the final Standards was achieved through focus groups, email consultation, circulation of the draft to members of the Project Reference Group, the Project Advisory Group, and members of their relevant organisations, and a period of open on-line consultation.\nThe Standards\nThe 22 Standards for practice are presented in the four domains that reflect the breadth of nursing in General Practice. \nProfessional practice  includes those standards that relate to aspects \nof nursing in General Practice concerning the professional role. Nursing care  reflects the clinical \ndelivery of nursing services to consumers in General Practice.  The General practice environment \nincorporates aspects of the nursing role that are organisational or environmental in nature. Finally, \nCollaborative practice  acknowledges the pivotal role of the nurse within the General \nPractice and broader primary health care team.\nThese Standards reflect the aspects of the nursing role unique to the general practice context \nand different from those which would be expected of the nurse in other clinical settings. Each Standard is followed by performance indicators that outline the key elements of the Standard against which the nurse’s practice can be evaluated. The way in which an individual nurse may demonstrate that they meet a particular performance indicator will differ and demonstrates the diversity of service delivery that characterises the general practice setting.\nGiven the requirement for registered nurses to provide supervision and delegation to enrolled \nnurses, the performance indicators reflect this relationship. Where a registered nurse works in a setting\n(1, 3) that does not employ enrolled nurses, the performance indicators relating to \ndelegation or supervision of enrolled nurses need not be demonstrated.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice15\nProfessional Practice\nStandard 1  Demonstrates an understanding of primary health care principles and nursing in  \n  general practice.\nStandard 2  Provides nursing care consistent with current nursing and general practice  \n  standards, guidelines, regulations and legislation.\nStandard 3  Actively builds and maintains professional relationships with other nurses and  \n  regularly engages in professional development activities.\nStandard 4  Advocates for the role of nursing in general practice. \nStandard 5  Demonstrates nursing leadership.\nNursing Care\nStandard 6  Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to provide safe, effective and evidence- \n  based nursing care.\nStandard 7  Undertakes nursing assessment and plans ongoing care.\nStandard 8  Effectively implements evidence-based health promotion and preventive care  \n  relevant to the Practice community.\nStandard 9  Empowers and advocates for consumers.\nStandard 10 Understands diversity in the Practice community and facilitates a safe,   \n  respectful and inclusive environment.\nStandard 11  Effectively delivers evidence-based health information to improve health literacy  \n  and promote self-management.\nStandard 12  Evaluates the quality and effectiveness of nursing care.\nGeneral Practice Environment \nStandard 13  Demonstrates proficiency in the use of information technology, clinical software  \n  and decision support tools to underpin health care delivery.\nStandard 14  Effectively uses registers and reminder systems to prompt intervention and  \n  promote best practice care.\nStandard 15 Understands the context of general practice within the wider Australian health  \n  care system, including funding models.\nStandard 16 Contributes to quality improvement and research activities to monitor and  \n  improve the standard of care provided in general practice.\nStandard 17 Participates in the development, implementation and evaluation of relevant  \n  policies and procedures.\nStandard 18  Monitors local population health issues to inform care and responds to changing  \n  community needs.\nStandard 19  Effectively manages human and physical resources.\nCollaborative Practice\nStandard 20  Builds and maintains professional and therapeutic relationships with   \n  consumers, their families and/or support person(s). \nStandard 21  Effectively communicates, shares information and works collaboratively with the  \n  general practice team. \nStandard 22  Liaises effectively with relevant agencies and health professionals to facilitate  \n  access to services and continuity of care.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General Practice16\nDomain 1: Professional Practice\nRegardless of the setting in which they are employed, nurses are regulated health professionals \nwith responsibility and accountability for their own practice(1, 3). Nurses must practise in a \nmanner consistent with current nursing and general practice standards, guidelines, regulations and legislation. To maintain their registration, each year nurses must meet the continuing professional development standard set by the NMBA\n(48). Nurses also need to actively monitor \ntheir own health, wellbeing and fitness to practice. As health professionals it is important that nurses build and maintain professional relationships with other nurses and demonstrate nursing leadership. In order to promote understanding of the role of nursing in General Practice it is vital that all nurses advocate for the role of nurses in General Practice. \nDomain 2: Nursing Care\nNurses have the knowledge and ability to provide comprehensive, evidence-based nursing care in the general practice setting. Nurses are integral to planning, implementing, co-ordinating, monitoring and evaluating health care within General Practice. This involves not only assessment and management of the immediate problem, but also includes health screening, preventive care, understanding the social and psychological context, health promotion and health maintenance. To provide high quality nursing care, the nurse will effectively use a range of communication strategies, sensitive to the individual’s values, beliefs, culture, sexual orientation, gender identity and personal context. The nurse will also empower the consumer by supporting their health literacy and the development of appropriate self-management skills. Where necessary, the nurse will also advocate for the consumer and their needs. To ensure that services are meeting the needs of individual consumers and/or the Practice population, nurses will reflect on the quality and effectiveness of their practice.\nDomain 3: General Practice Environment \nWorking in Australian General Practice presents nurses with a range of unique challenges. To work effectively in this setting the nurse requires specific knowledge and skills relating to General Practice, and its role within the broader primary health care environment. In addition to their clinical expertise, nurses in this context of practice need to be cognisant of the imperatives of small business viability and sustainability. Nurses in General Practice also require skills in the use of information technology and in data management to prompt intervention and promote best practice. As health professionals, nurses also play an important role in quality improvement, practice-based research and the development, implementation and evaluation of relevant policies and procedures. With the growing recognition of the role of General Practice in meeting local population health needs, nurses are critical to identifying and monitoring local population health issues and responding to changing community needs. \nDomain 4: Collaborative Practice\nNurses in General Practice build and foster relationships with their Practice population, members of the general practice team, other health professionals, community agencies and other organisations to optimise outcomes for consumers. Given the close and often ongoing relationship between nurses and consumers, their families and/or support person(s), nurses are ideally placed to assess and manage a range of health needs. Nurses in General Practice recognise when it is appropriate to consult with, or refer to, other members of the general practice team. Nurses are often recognised as leaders in collaboration with others to enable the integration of care, particularly in the general practice setting.\nNational Practice Standards for Nurses in General

Researchhas shown that families of people who have doneadvance care planning have less anxiety and stresswhen asked to be involved in important healthcaredecisions.\nMAKING HEALTHCARE DECISIONS FOR OTHERS CAN BE \nDIFFICULT. AN ADVANCE CARE PLAN CAN GIVE PEACE OF MIND AND COMFORT AS PREFERENCES ARE CLEAR, UNDERSTOOD AND RESPECTED.Benefits for you and the people you care for Advanced illness or serious injury can sometimes mean \nthat people cannot make their own choices about healthcare. This can happen to people of all ages, and especially towards end of life. \nWriting an Advance Care Plan lets a person say what they \nwould want, if they ever became unable to communicate for themselves. If you knew someone who became very unwell \nand was not able to communicate their wishes to others, would you know what they wanted? Could you speak on their behalf? \nWhat does a substitute decision-maker do?\nWhen a person prepares their Advance Care Plan, they \nmay invite someone to be their substitute decision-maker. If the person loses the ability to make their own healthcare decisions, the substitute decision-maker can then make decisions on their behalf. The Advance Care Plan will provide direction and guidance.\nSome state/territory laws may allow for more than one \nsubstitute decision-maker to be appointed.\nAN INITIATIVE OF\nAUSTIN HEALTH替代决策者如何在预先护理计划上提供帮助 ？\n持开放心态\n做好准备在病人制定其预先护理计划时，务必作出如下鼓励。\n• 与他们谈论他们的价值观、期望和人生目标。确\n保您理解并尊重他们所选择的医疗保健与临终关怀的方式以及所持的偏好。\n• 如果您反对他们的某些想法，对他们说实话。请记住，您可能会被要求为他们代言。如果你们的想法差异很大，他们最好另觅他人。\n• 与持有非常不同的看法的家庭成员谈论任何潜在的问题。您会如何应付可能出现的任何分歧呢？他们是否知道病人的愿望？他们知道您是替代决策者吗？\n• 如果您同意成为替代决策者， 请讨论他们是否希望您被依法任命。可在 www.advancecareplanning.\norg.au 网站上获取进一步信息。• 如果有人要求您成为他们的替代决策者，在您同意前想一想这可能对您意味着什么。\n您将需要：\n• 有空（最好住在同一个城市或地区）\n• 年满 18岁以上\n• 准备好在与医生、其他健康专业人员和家庭成\n员交谈时清楚、自信地代表病人说话。\n• 鼓励他们思考与医疗保健相关的期望、价值观和偏好\n• 鼓励他们向他们的医疗团队、合作伙伴、家庭成员和亲密的朋友诉说自己的偏好。How can a substitute decision-maker help \nwith advance care planning?\nBe openIt is important to encourage the following when the \nperson is making their Advance Care Plan.\n• If someone asks you to be their substitute decision-maker, think about what it might mean for you \nbefore you agree. \nYou will need to be:\n• available (ideally live in the same city or region)\n• over the age of 18\n• prepared to advocate clearly and confidently \non their behalf when talking to doctors, other \nhealth professionals and family members.\n• Encourage them to think about their beliefs, values \nand preferences for healthcare.\n• Encourage them to talk through their preferences with their healthcare team, partner, family members \nand close friends.\nBe ready\n• Talk with them about their values, beliefs, and life \ngoals. Make sure you understand and respect their \napproach to and preferences for healthcare and \nend-of-life care.\n• If they have beliefs that you are opposed to, be honest with them. Remember that you may be \ncalled upon to advocate for them. If your beliefs are \ntoo different, it may be better for them to choose \nsomeone else.\n• Talk about any potential issues that may arise with \nfamily members or partners who have very different \nviews. How will you cope with any disagreement \nthat could arise? Have they been made aware of \nthe person’s wishes? Do they know you are the \nsubstitute decision-maker?\n• If you agree to be a substitute decision-maker, discuss whether they want you to be legally \nappointed.

RN’s will also undertake Core Components of Level Two appropriate to their role within the organisation.\nContractors such as agency clinical/care delivery (RN, EN, AINs), physiotherapists, cleaners, laundry, kitchen, and maintenance workers who are not on fixed term contract will be briefed by the handover RN or CCC or another member of the Leadership Team. A WHS checklist will be used on these occasions.\nGeneral Practitioners who are regularly attending the organisation will be given a general handbook to read. \nConsumers and their representative/s are briefed on their WHS responsibilities pre-admission. Information is also included in the Consumer Handbook and is part of the admission process. \nVisitors are educated via our Work Health and Safety Policy and Anthem’s Statement of Commitment, which is displayed in the entrance foyer and emergency and safety signage throughout the building.\nThe FM is responsible for the development and review of all WHS Induction and Training modules and associated documents.\nIn addition, all service contracts with external providers include a clause which outlines their and their employees and/or subcontractors WHS responsibilities. \n\nTraining for HSRs and WHS Committee Members\nHSRs will be provided with training, as required and if requested under NSW WHS legislation and further training as deemed appropriate by the HSR and the organisation. \nHSRs are able to choose their course of training (in keeping with the education procedures) to enable them to avoid delays in undertaking their role by waiting for prescribed courses. \nWithin three months of the training request, Anthem will allow HSRs to be absent from work to attend training; and pay the course fees and other reasonable costs associated with attendance at the course in addition to the HSRs ordinary pay for the duration of the course.\nMembers of the WHS Committee will also have the opportunity for additional training based on an individual and Committee needs analysis and in consultation with their supervisor.  \n \nWHS Consultation\nPurpose\nConsultation, cooperation and communication with workers about matters that affect their health or safety at work is a legal requirement and an essential component of managing the work health and safety. It is a key component in keeping a workplace safe. The FM and Leadership Team {Person Conducting Business or Undertaking (PCBU)and Officers} have a duty under WHS legislation to consult, so far as reasonably practicable, with workers who are, or who are likely to be directly affected by a health and safety matter. ‘Reasonably practicable’ consultation is that which is both possible and reasonable for the particular circumstances.\nEffective consultation ensures that there is sufficient information to make informed decisions and the workers who are or may be affected are given a reasonable opportunity to provide their views and understand the reason for the decisions taken. In some circumstances, an urgent response might be needed and consultation will not be possible but this would be the exception.\nWorkers generally have the best knowledge about work practices that pose health and safety risks and any gaps in the present arrangements in the organisation so are in the best position to offer suggestions. Their input is critical to the success of the WHS program of the organisation. Consultation between workers can significantly improve decision making and can assist in reducing work related injuries and disease.\nAll workers are entitled to take part in consultation and can choose to be represented by a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) who is elected to represent their work group.  \nWhen another business shares the same workplace the FM and/or Leadership Team has a duty to consult in matters relating to WHS that have an impact on both businesses. \nThe FM, or the person who commissions construction work, must consult with the designer of the structures in relation to WHS matters.\nIn addition, suppliers and manufacturers must also be consulted in relation to WHS matters. Examples include, but are not limited to chemical cleaning suppliers, oxygen suppliers and hoist suppliers. \n\nScope\nAs a minimum, consultation will occur with employees and other workers in the following times and circumstances: \nIdentifying hazards and assessing risks arising from the work carried out or to be carried out.\nMaking decisions about ways to eliminate or minimise those risks.\nMaking decisions about the adequacy of facilities for the workers such as toilets, drinking water facilities, workers rooms, change rooms, personal effects storage and first aid management. \nProposing changes that may affect the health or safety of workers including but not limited to shift work rosters, work procedures and or the work environment.\nMaking decisions about procedures for consulting with employees. \nResolving health or safety issues.\nWorker health monitoring.\nMonitoring the conditions at the workplace. \nProviding information and training for employees and workers.\t\nDevelopment of organisational issue resolution procedures if departing from the procedure as set in the WHS Act.\n\nOutcomes of all consultation must be shared with all workers including supporting rationale for decision making. All consultation with workers should be documented. Documentation will include the following:\nWhat the safety matter is?\nWho was likely to be affected or who was affected?\nWho was involved in consultation?\nKey issues identified. \nDecision outcomes and supporting rationale.\nDecision implementation – who is responsible and by when?\nDate of implementation. \nHow decisions are to be reviewed as part of CQI process.\n\nActions taken as a result of consultation should be recorded. Even a simple referral to higher levels of management creates a record that can assist in demonstrating that all reasonable care was taken.\n\nConsultation Process\nConsultation will take place in a variety of ways, including but not limited to the following processes: \nSurveys – written and verbal\nInvitation to submit suggestions \nWorkers’ meeting\nVia HSR if applicable\nHandover meeting\nOrganisational agreed procedures. \n\nConsultation Arrangements \nConsultation will take place within the organisation through Health and Safety Representatives (HSR) and WHS Committee (if a committee is in place):\nThe HSR/s have a primary role in representing workers on WHS consultation matters.  \nThe roles and responsibility of the HSR and the WHS committee are defined in Part 5 of the Work Health and Safety Act.\nConsultation will also take place with work health and safety duty holders of other organisations working with, for or on behalf of our organisation and who share work health and safety responsibilities and duties with us.\n\nOrganisations that have service agreements with other organisations to assist in the delivery of business operations have a duty of care to consult with such organisations and their workers. Similarly, the provider of such services, also has a duty to consult their workers. In such cases both parties must consult and develop a plan to consult with the workers on work health and safety matters which will or are likely to affect them. The process, plan and outcomes should be clearly documented and reviewed according to an organisational Continuous Quality Improvement Policy and Procedures. \n\nHealth and Safety Representatives (HSRs) \nA worker can request that the person conducting a business or undertaking to facilitate an election for an HSR(s). Anthem will then facilitate the determination of the work groups. An employee must be a member of the work group to be elected as the HSR for and by the members of that work group.  A worker may be a volunteer to be elected to be an HSR. Any elected HSR will serve for a term of three years and will be able to re-nominate for further terms.\n\nProcedures for HSR election\nWorkers of the particular workgroup will determine how the election is to be conducted. \nWorkers may request that their union represent them in the consultation negotiations. The Union’s involvement is limited to the negotiation of the work group but if the workers make the request, the person conducting the business or undertaking must not exclude the union representative. Fines can apply for a breach. An election will not be required if the number of candidates equals the number of vacancies\n\nAn HSR ceases to hold office if the HSR: \nResigns as the HSR (submitted in writing to the PCBU). \nCeases to be an employee of the workgroup. \nIs disqualified. \nIs removed as the HSR by majority of workgroup.\nIs disqualification by the authority (Safe Work NSW). \n\nObligations of Anthem to HSRs:\nAllow access to information on hazards and the health and safety of employees and other persons as deemed appropriate of the workgroup (information must not contain any information that may allow identification) without the worker’s consent.\nAllow the HSR to be present at interviews between a worker, an inspector and the organisation (with the worker’s consent).\nProvide reasonable facilities, time and assistance. \nAllow the HSR to accompany an inspector during an inspection; and share costs associated with HSRs where the PCBU is involved with multiple businesses or undertakings.\n\nAnthem, if requested by an HSR, will allow the HSR to attend a course: \nApproved by SafeWork NSW.\nChosen by the HSR in consultation with the organisation.\nIf an agreement on training is not reached an inspector can be requested to assist in the decision and attendance of training is to be within three months of the request.\n\nPowers and Functions of an HSR\nThe primary function of a health and safety representative (HSR) is to represent workers in their work group in relation to health and safety matters. To carry out this function they may:\nMonitor WHS actions taken by the organisation.\nInvestigate WHS complaints from workers of the work group. \nInquire into anything that appears to be a risk to the health or safety of workers in the work group arising from the conduct of the business or undertaking. \nIf an HSR has completed approved HSR training, they can exercise additional powers as defined in the WHS Act and Regulations.\n\nHSR Role  \nTo review actions taken to ensure the health, safety and welfare of people at the place of work.\nTo investigate any matter that may be a risk to health and safety at the place of work.\nTo attempt to resolve any WHS matter (in consultation with the Leadership Team). If unresolved then a WHS inspector can be requested.\nTo accompany a worker of the workgroup that the representative represents at the request of the employee/worker, during any interview by the employer on any WHS issue.\nTo be an observer during any formal in-house investigation of an incident or other occurrence at the relevant place of work that is required to be notified to SafeWork NSW.\nTo accompany an inspector during an inspection of a workplace at which a worker in the work group works. \nTo assist in the review and development; and promote the recording of workplace hazards and incident to promote improved workplace health and safety.\nTo raise WHS issues with managers on behalf of the workers they represent.\nUndertake inspections and investigations as required.\nReceive information concerning the work health and safety of workers in the work group. \nRequest the assistance of any person with technical expertise or skills that can assist in inspecting the workplace and advise on managing a particular hazard or negotiate a particular issue.\nMonitoring of WHS performance.\nReview implementation of WHS policies and programs and be involved in the development of WHS improvement plans.\n\nHealth and Safety Committee \nThe health and safety representative can request the establishment of a Health and Safety Committee (refer to Work Health and Safety Act 2011, Section 68(2)(e)). A committee can also be requested by five or more workers. A committee often provides an organisation with the opportunity to involve overlapping duty holders.  \nIf requested to establish a committee by the HSR or five or more workers, the person conducting the business or undertaking must do so and will ensure:\nThe functions of a Health and Safety Committee are to:\nFacilitate cooperation between the business and workers in instigating, developing and carrying out measures designed to ensure the workers’ health and safety at work.\nAssist in developing standards, rules and procedures relating to health and safety that are to be followed or complied with at the workplace. \nIn consultation with workers, can determine the appropriate health and safety activities such as: \nThe formulation of agreed procedures, such as issue resolution procedures and committee’s own procedures.\nAnalysing reports of hazards, work-related incidents and statistical trends, so that reports can be made to the Leadership Team.\nMaking recommendations for corrective action.\nExamining health and safety audit or monitoring reports.\nConsidering reports and information provided by inspectors.\nConsidering reports that health and safety representatives may wish to submit.\nDeveloping procedures for selecting new plant for the workplace.\nAssistance in the development of safe working procedures.\nLinking with workers’ compensation and return to work programs.\nThe selection of consultants.\nOnce a committee is established, the following will apply:\nThe Committee will develop and review their terms of reference on annual basis.\nThe Committee must have access to information kept by the employer relating to accidents and occupational/work diseases that occur at the workplace. \nCosts associated with committee duties will be approved by the FM. Committee annual budgets/estimations will be developed in consultation with the committee and FM and CM.  \nThe agenda of the committee will be made available to all workers at least two weeks before regular scheduled meetings by the following processes:\nDisplay in the workers’ staff room.\nElectronic communication to all employees and other appropriate workers.\nEmployee meetings.\nIf agreement is not reached relating to the terms of reference and agenda of the meeting (after a reasonable time) any party may ask SafeWork NSW to appoint an inspector to decide the matter.  \nThe makeup of the committee is agreed to between the workers and the organisation. Management can only nominate up to half of the members.\nMinutes of committee meetings will be kept and a copy sent to each HSR for the workgroup/s covered by the committee and also to officers of the organisation.\n\nIf HSRs are requested by employees:\nAn HSR may be a member of the Health and Safety Committee (HSC) if they consent. Where there are two or more HSRs, they may choose one or more of their number to be HSC members. However, at least half the members of the committee must be workers not nominated by the PCBU. An inspector can assist when agreement cannot be reached and may determine the constitution or that an HSC should not be established.\n\nVacancy of Office on the Committee\nA person ceases to be a member of the committee when:\nTheir contract of employment/contract with Anthem is terminated. \nThe member resigns from the committee.\nA worker’s representative is withdrawn by a majority vote of the workers they represent.\nThe HSR is disqualified.\nWhere a casual vacancy exists, the chairperson may invite a worker from the same area representative to the committee to hold office until next elections or if elected the deputy HSR may take up the vacancy.\nAnthem will consult workers about new elections when:\nA worker member of the HSC or an HSR resigns.\nThe composition of the workgroup changes.\n\nWHS Issue Resolution Process\nWorkers will be consulted on all proposed changes to the work environment, equipment, policies, protocols and procedures that may affect their health and safety.\nInformation on hazards, work health and safety activities and achievements will be disseminated to workers and to Leadership Team through relevant committee minutes, workers meetings, memos, publication of audit findings.\nWorkers may approach either their manager or their WHS representative to bring forward issues in the workplace.\nThe standard Issue Resolution Procedure from the WHS Regulations has been adopted by Anthem and is as follows:\nAny party to a WHS issue may commence the issue resolution procedure by informing each other party that there is an issue to be resolved, and the nature and scope of the issue\nAs soon as parties are informed of the issue, all parties must meet or communicate with each other to attempt to resolve the issue.\nThe parties must have regard to all relevant matters, including:\nDegree and immediacy of risk to workers or other persons affected by the issue.\nNumber and location of workers and other persons affected by the issue.\nMeasures (both temporary and permanent) that must be implemented to resolve the issue.\nWho will be responsible for implementing the resolution measures.\nA party may, in resolving the issue, be assisted or represented by a person nominated by the party.\nIf the issue is resolved, details of the issue and its resolution must be set out in a written agreement if any party to the issue requests this.\nIf a written agreement is prepared all parties to the issue must be satisfied that the agreement reflects the resolution of the issue.\nA copy of the written agreement must be given to all parties to the issue, and if requested, to the health and safety committee for the workplace.\nNothing in this procedure prevents a worker from bringing a work health and safety issue to the attention of the worker’s health and safety representative. \n\nRisk Management\nOrganisational Responsibilities \nThe WHS Act and Regulations require persons who have a duty to ensure health and safety to manage risks by eliminating health and safety risks so far as is reasonably practicable, and if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate a risk, to minimise the risk as far as is reasonably practicable.\nThe Board must have sufficient understanding of the hazards and risks associated at Anthem to ensure there are sufficient resources and processes to eliminate or minimise the risk. \nThe FM is responsible for ensuring there are policies and procedures implemented for managing health and safety risks and minimising risk as far as is reasonably practicable.\nThe Leadership Team are responsible for ensuring Risk Management Policy and Procedures are implemented within the workplace and workers are consulted when directly affected by a health and safety matter.\nWorkers are responsible for following policy and procedures that have been implemented to eliminate or minimise the hazard and risk.\nConsultation is a key element in the risk management process and must include as far as practicable all employees and other workers throughout the organisation.\n\nRisk Management Process \nThe risk management process is outlined in the Risk Management Policy and Procedures. \n\nWHS Record Keeping and Monitoring/Review \nRecords\nAnthem will maintain WHS records according to legislative requirements including but not limited to:\nInjury/Incident reports, analysis and

ensure the WHS system is effective and to identify areas for improvement.\nThe record keeping methods will also be reviewed regularly to ensure compliance and suitability, and to identify areas for improvement.\n\nWHS Monitoring and Review \nTo achieve continuous quality improvement in WHS, Anthem will regularly monitor and review WHS policies, procedures, and practices. This will require a review (or internal/external audit) of each of the components of WHS, including:\nAnnual system review.\t\nMonthly analysis and reports of incidents and hazards.\nWHS legislative compliance.\nAnnual review of the suitability, compliance of policy and procedures. \nRole of the WHS. \nReporting of information to Executive and Board level.\nReporting of information to workers and other relevant persons including Consumers.\nThe outcomes of these reviews will form the basis for continuous improvement in WHS.  \n\nInjury Management in the Workplace \nFirst Aid Management \nScope \nFirst aid management of Consumers is separate from WHS Policy and Procedure and is covered under Incident Management and Education and Development Policies and Procedures. \n\nResponsibilities\nThe FM has overall responsibility for ensuring there are effective systems to manage first aid on site, including ensuring:\nAppropriately trained workers.\nAdequate and easily accessible first aid supplies and documented procedures.\nAll first aid incidents are documented in the Worker Register of Incidents. \nFirst aid management is reviewed annually or more often as required in consultation with employees and the WHS Committee. \nEducation to all workers is provided at induction and as part of annual manual task training.\nAppropriate information (ensuring privacy rights are maintained) is provided for discussion analysis/review and evaluation.\n\nTimely and accurate reports will be provided to Leadership Team and the Board. \n\nOther managers (catering, housekeeping, office, maintenance, lifestyle, care and nursing /clinical managers) are responsible for consulting with their direct reports on first aid management including the identification of workplace risks and control strategies and are responsible for assisting in the post evaluation of reported incidents within their area of responsibility.\n\nWorkers and other relevant person are responsible for:\nFollowing the organisational WHS Policy and Procedures, which are implemented to minimise and control the risk of accidents within the workplace. This includes first aid management policy and procedures. All workers are expected to ensure they can locate first aid equipment and know how to escalate first aid requirements to the appropriate person. \n\nConsumers and their representatives are consulted when any new initiatives are being considered and are invited to make suggestion to improve first aid management.  \n\nFirst aid preparedness \nRisk management strategies for first aid are included as part of WHS risk management and continuous quality improvement processes.\nIt is essential that organisational first aid responders are aware and have access to additional first aid training to effectively manage the types of accident that are more likely to occur within our industry and workplace. \n\n\nInjuries associated with common hazards in our workplace that may require first aid:\n\nAll workers delivering first aid will know where First Aid Kits are kept, who is the designated first aid provider and where Safety Data Sheets are kept for immediate access in the event of a chemical accident.\n \nFirst Aid Administration\nFirst aid kits are purchased based on assessment of needs and relevant standards. \nAre branded with appropriate signage, according to AS 1319 – Safety Signs for the Occupational Environment.   \nAre clearly displayed by hanging on a visible wall.\nAdditional stock can be used from the clinical treatment room in the case of an emergency.\n\nLocations of First Aid Kits are as follows: (list kit locations by workplace area) \nKitchen \nLaundry\nFoyer \nClinical Areas – each Care station \nBus/Anthem vehicle \nMaintenance.\n\nRestocking of First Aid Kits:\nAs soon as practicable after being used, it is the responsibility of RN to ensure restocking of the first aid kit is completed but the task may be delegated to an AIN who is competent in restocking and documenting stock balances.   \nRestocking and regular stock checks is documented using maintenance Preventative maintenance schedule which is kept maintenance\nKits are secured with a fine easily breakable tie and tagged with the date checked and by whom. The tags are kept secured in first aid folder which is accessible by the RN.\nIf the tag is not broken, then regular checks can be at longer intervals of yearly to content expiry dates. This strategy is also a control measure to reduce miscellaneous and inappropriate use of product.\nStock analysis and evaluation of the types of product in our first aid kits is undertaken annually or more frequently as required. \n\nDesignated First Aid Provider \nThe immediate responsibility of all designated first aiders in any workplace injury is to provide effective first aid and to ensure the injured person/s receive the appropriate medical attention.\nThe RN is the designated First Aid Officer on each shift and is responsible for:\nUndertaking First Aid Procedures and if required emergency CPR.  \nDirecting other employees to assist as appropriate. \n\nRelevant Employee First Aid Training \nAll RNs and Enrolled Nurses (ENs) are required to hold and provide verification of the following qualifications as part of their contract of employment:\nNationally recognised Statement/s of Attainment issued by a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) for the nationally endorsed advanced first aid unit/s of competency. \nAny workers member transporting or taking a Consumer on an external activity are required to hold: \nNationally recognised Statement/s of Attainment issued by a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) for the nationally endorsed first aid unit/s of competency. \n\nWorkers’ first aid training records are held within the Anthem server and in the Education Coordinator’s office. \n\nFirst aid procedures and emergency phone numbers \nare documented in the Emergency Management Manual and \non Emergency flip charts in all nurses’ station, kitchen, laundry and reception areas \n\nAutomated external defibrillators\nAutomated external defibrillators are designed to be used by trained or untrained person.\nAnthem has (insert number) automated external defibrillators located in the following areas: \n(List locations and, if possible, identify position on a map of the Home)\nAs part of our risk management process, it has been decided by the Leadership Team in consultation with workers including relatives of our Consumers, that the provision of automated external defibrillators is appropriate. \nThe following considerations were taken into consideration:\nEmployee safety and first aid management.  \nThe age of many of our visitors – a high proportion are over 60.\nThe geographic location of the Home and emergency service response times. \nConsumer emergency support (Refer to Consumer Care Delivery Policy and Procedures for cardiac arrest).\nAnthem provides annual compulsory training for all RNs who have not attended an external training course in the use of defibrillators. \nDefibrillator should be located in an area that is clearly visible, accessible and not exposed to extreme temperatures. \nThey should be clearly signed and maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications.  \n\nPost Trauma Management\nThe person in charge should assess the psychological health status of witnesses and others involved in the incident. Depending on the severity, support measures may have to be implemented to support affected persons. \n \nEscalation of Critical Safety Incidents \nIncident Management Policy and Procedures must be read in conjunction with First Aid Management. \nThe CM and RN in Charge are responsible for escalating ‘notifiable incidents’ as per the Incident procedures. \n\nDocumentation Requirements \nAn Accident/Incident Report Form and/or will be completed as soon as practical after the incident by the worker or RN. \nThe record of the incident must be placed in the Worker Register of Incidents by the CM. \n \nWorkers Compensation and Return to Work\nWorkers’ Compensation\nFor employee work-related injuries and illnesses, Anthem has workers’ compensation insurance and a documented return to work program.  \n\nThe following procedures outline our commitment and the processes undertaken if a worker is injured in the workplace.  \n\nResponsibilities\nThe FM is responsible for ensuring:\nThe Anthem holds Workers’ Compensation insurance.\nThere is a documented return to work program with describes the steps the organisation undertakes if a worker is injured. \nThe insurance provider is notified within 48 hours of workplace injuries.\nParticipation in the development and ensuring organisational compliance with the injured workers management plan as defined by the insurer. \nThe provision of suitable work (as far as reasonably practical) when the worker is able to return to work on either a full time or part-time basis.\nThe provision of suitable work that is (as far as reasonably practical) the same or equivalent to the work being performed at the time of the injury.  \nCompliance with maintaining the employment of the injured worker as per section 248 of the Workers Compensation Act 1987.\nThe display of the ‘If you get injured’ poster in the workplace. \nDocumentation compliance with the register of workplace injuries and illnesses.\nCompliance of recording of the worker’s wages and ensuring compensation payments to the worker.\nReview and risk management, controls relating to the cause of the injury and education and consultation with workers of any subsequent risk control measures that are to be implemented.\nPositive support and engagement with the worker during the injury and recovery period.\nEffective management of disputes according to regulatory requirements. \n\nInitial Injury Management\nEffective first aid management in accordance with best practice first aid.\nDocumentation of details of the incident recorded in the Workers Register of Injuries.  \nIf required, notification to SafeWork of incident if notifiable as per Incident Management Policy and Procedures.\n\nJourney Claims\nInjuries sustained while travelling to and from the place of work are generally no longer able to be claimed under workers’ compensation.   \nA claim for an injury sustained during travel can only be made if there is a real and substantial connection between the employment and the incident out of which the injury arose.

Design factors include increased illuminance levels during daytime supporting the Consumers visual age, the important of the human circadian cycle and lighting on health and well-being, and the role light can play in assisting the well-being of persons with dementia.\nOur lighting systems have been designed to enable employees and other persons conducting work duties, to safely carry out work related tasks. \nIt is acknowledged that meeting the lighting (illuminance) needs of Consumers’ safety and well-being and addressing the needs of employees especially during the hours of natural darkness can pose challenges. It is also acknowledged that illuminance levels required for specific tasks are age related. For example, task illumination level requirements vary between workers – as the eye ages the pupil becomes smaller and the crystalline lens becomes thicker and for same task the amount of light reaching the retina of a 50-year-old may be half that reaching the retina of a typical 20-year-old.  \nRisk management identification and control is essential to meet the WHS needs of individual workers. \n\nOrganisation Minimum Standards that must be adhered to at all times\nLighting systems installed are compliance with legislation, regulatory requirements and industry standards.\nLighting switch boards are clearly defined and are secured from unauthorised access. \nPreventative and regular maintenance to all lighting systems including emergency lighting carried out as per legislative and regulatory requirements and the manufacturer’s recommendations by the appropriately qualified personnel and documented accordingly.\nAll faults are immediately reported to the RN in Charge on each shift and the Maintenance Officer and are written in the maintenance request book. \nIssues and faults detected after hours are processed in accordance with the after-hours escalation policy and procedure. \nRegular environmental audits. \n\n\nThe FM is responsible so far as reasonably practical for ensuring:\nLighting systems provide essential lighting appropriate for the specific needs of the workers and Consumers.\nEffective lighting is in place to ensure all employees and other persons engaged in providing on site work duties can safely carry out their duties.\nLighting systems are compliant with legislation and industry standards. \nSpecialist advice, workers and Consumer consultation is sought for all new systems and major lighting alterations.\nRegular and preventative lighting system maintenance is carried out in accordance with legislation and industry standards, manufacturers recommendations by appropriately qualified personnel. \nThere an effective policy and procedure for afterhours escalation of essential services faults.  \nWorkers and Consumers are educated and understand their WHS responsibilities. \nContinuous quality improvement management systems regularly monitor the effectiveness of lighting systems including identified hazard management and the improvements and resolution of identified risks.\nThe Board and/or FM of the organisation is supplied with timely and accurate reports.\n  \nThe Maintenance Officer is responsible so far as is reasonably practicable for ensuring: \nRegular and preventative lighting maintenance is carried out as per the organisational policies and procedures and in accordance with legislation and industry standards and guidelines.\nLighting hazards are resolved in keeping with the organisational risk management and hazard identification policy and procedures.\nLighting systems audits are completed in a timely and accurate manner. \nEffective and timely reporting of lighting issues are reported to the Maintenance Officer.\n\nSupervisor and managers of services and/or shifts are responsible for ensuring:\nEmployees and other persons carrying out work duties, Consumers and visitors are aware of relevant work health and safety issues that may acutely arise in the workplace. WHS issues are part of the shift handover communication process.  \nManaging emergency situations (Emergency Policy and Procedures).\nLighting issues are escalated according to policy and procedure. \nHazards identification and control measures are implemented as per policy and procedure including hazard identification/incident reporting. \nParticipating in environmental safety audits as required.\nAssisting and educating employees in their WHS responsibilities. \n\nAll Employees and other persons undertaking work duties are responsible for: \nReporting to their supervisor if the current lighting is not sufficient to complete any work duties.\nTaking reasonable care for their own safety.\nUnderstanding WHS policy and implementing safe work procedures relevant to their position and work duties \nResponding appropriately to emergency situations (refer to Emergency Policy and Procedures).\nReporting hazards, injuries and incidents to the immediate supervisor and completing the required documentation. \nParticipating in WHS discussion and consultation and training.\nCo-operation in safety audits, inspections and investigations.\n\nAnthem ’s lighting systems can be categorised into four areas:\nInternal lighting\nExternal lighting \nEmergency lighting\nPortable lighting. \nThe key risk management requirements of each, including hazard identification and control and CQI are outlined under these headings.\n\nInternal lighting\nAs stated in the introduction, the organisational lighting management system is designed to address the health and well-being of our Consumers. Lighting levels are either automatically or manually) controlled to align with the human circadian system and are dimmed during nighttime.\nThis system is automatically over-ridden if the fire alarm is activated and can be manually overridden from each area via switches located in ground floor of each building.\nThe design of the building incorporates natural and artificial light except in storerooms and some clinical areas.\nInternal lighting must: \nBe adequate for all workers to carry out work duties effectively and safely, assist in identifying or recognising hazards in the workplace\nProvide levels of illuminance so as not to cause adverse risks such as eye strain, headaches, and poor posture when completing tasks \nAdditional specific portable lighting is able on site for high visual tasks. These include: \nClinical lamp for Consumer physical examination and wound management kept in each clinical treatment room or (insert locations).\nPortable LED battery operated medication trolley lighting (charging responsibilities in Night Duty RN task list or (insert locations).\nBack up torches and portable lights for maintenance kept in maintenance office or (insert locations).\nBack up torch or portable LED lamp kept on permanent charge in kitchen and (insert other locations).   \nBack up torches, head lights and portable battery LED lamps for emergencies kept (insert location). Refer to Emergency Management Manual.\n\nGlare\nWork areas should be free from glare. Glare-free lighting improves visual acuity and reduces eyestrain. Reflective glare can occur as light source is reflected from glossy or highly reflective surfaces. Strategies to reduce reflective glare are the use of matte surfaces. Glare can also be caused via natural light – specific window glass, shades, curtain and blinds can be used to reduce natural glare. \nElectronic display screens used with computers, electronic monitoring devices, televisions information screens and mobile phones are affected by lighting and natural light reflections known as veiling reflections and negative affects visual performance.\nTo avoid veiling reflections screen should be situated perpendicularly to the light source. \n\nRisk management strategies for potential lighting internal hazards: \nIllumination level requirements may vary from person to person. Certain factors such as age and eye degeneration can affect the individual’s optimal illumination levels to undertake tasks accurately and with maximin efficiency. \nAs part of the safety culture and WHS Policy all persons are responsible for their own safety and therefore if the lighting is not correct for individuals to complete task without causing eyestrain, headaches and or poor posture then your immediate supervisor or leader should be notified. \n\nControl measures include:\nRegular audits evaluating lighting factors related to critical tasks and other essential services in the aged care Home including but not limited to:\nMedication administration – this is a critical safety task and considered an area where high levels over 800 illuminances (lux) are required. Effective lighting strategies are required especially for afternoon and night workers when areas such as corridors and bedrooms may be at low levels of illuminance. Adequate lighting should be provided such as battery-operated LED lights on medication trolleys and extra lighting in Consumer room medication cupboards.  \nCleaning services – do all areas have adequate illuminance for effective and efficient cleaning. Areas such as foyers often have ambient lighting, these can be manually changed for cleaning tasks.\nAre lights flickering or is the light intensity changing? (Older fluorescent lights were prone to flickering. It is recommended that these are changed, as there is potential for the triggering of fitting in photosensitive epilepsy.)\nWorkforce and Consumer surveys collect areas of workplace/Home improvements.\nWorkforce suggestions/improvement ideas log. \nAnalysis of contributing factors in reported incidents especially fall slips and trips, medication errors.  \nExternal specialist illumination audits and recommendations. \nWHS meeting discussions.\nWHS lighting issues raised at handover meeting/workers meetings and Consumer and relative meetings. \nConsultation so far as is reasonably practicable, with all workers including Consumers is an integral part of the WHS risk management process. \nOutcomes of audits – hazards and/or areas for improvement are included in the WHS meetings and consultation with the HSR and health and safety committee (if committee is part on the organisation).  \nAppendix One outlines the illumination standards for various activities and tasks.\n\nExternal Lighting Systems     \nExternal lighting systems are essential for the safety and security of workers and other Consumers during the hours of darkness and at other times when there is low visibility due to weather conditions.\nAnthem has an automated external lighting management system which operates (insert whether light-intensity sensors are manually controlled [and role of Person Responsible] or system timer controlled). \nThe external lighting system provides persons with a clear view of the carpark and foyer entrance during the hours of darkness. All services entrances and exit doors are also illuminated.\nIn addition, entrances and exits to the Home are illuminated.\nEnvironmental audits are regularly conducted and risk management strategies, hazard control and evaluation processes are the same as detailed under Internal lighting.\n\nEmergency Lighting\nAnthem ’s emergency lighting management system is installed and maintained in accordance with legislation, regulations and industry standards. \nThis system includes emergency signage, stairwell lighting and an Emergency Lighting Management system that operates in the event of power failure for an estimated period of (insert number) hours. \nEmergency supplies of portable torches head lights and battery LED lamps are kept evacuation packs.\nFor more information about Lighting in Emergency situations refer to the Emergency Policy and Procedure Manual and Emergency Flip charts kept in maintenance office.\n\nManagement of Hazards associated with Oxygen    \nMedical oxygen is an essential gas that is required as part of clinical care delivery to some of our Consumers.\nThe Home has a built-in Consumer delivery system of oxygen in rooms (insert room names, numbers, or locations). \nThe Home also has portable oxygen cylinders for the delivery of oxygen to Consumers. These are stored in (insert locations).\n\nResponsibilities \nThe FM has overall responsibility for ensuring the safe storage, use and disposal of oxygen cylinders.\n\nThe Maintenance Officer is responsible for:\nThe ordering and oversight of delivery.\nEnsuring the external storage area in compliant with safety standards. \nTransporting oxygen cylinders to clinical areas at the request of nursing workers.\nEnsuring large cylinders are secured correctly on cylinder trolley and secured to the wall if required.\nStock management and ordering of oxygen.\n\nThe CM is responsible for ensuring:\nWorkers are educated in the safety risks associated with the use of Oxygen.\nEnsuring RNs are competent in the safe management of oxygen / suctioning delivery.\nConsumers are aware of their responsibility for oxygen safety.\n\nRNs are responsible for:\nEnsuring Consumers are aware of their responsibility for oxygen safety.\nFor the safe clinical delivery of oxygen and suctioning.\nUndertaking safety checks on internal stored oxygen as per the Oxygen Checklist (or insert form name and/or number kept (insert location)). \n\nAll PCAs are responsible for reporting any concerns in relation to oxygen safety immediately to the RN. \n\nStorage\nMedical oxygen cylinders will be stored in accordance with AS 4332: The storage and Handling of Gas in Cylinders.

Specific training for workers involved in Consumer care delivery includes skills for managing the Consumer during manual handling processes. All workers are to follow the guidelines as per appropriate SWMS and manufacturer equipment guidelines.\nAll workers involved in Consumer care involving the use of lifting equipment must also pass an annual mandatory competency test.\nThere are adequate allied health professional physiotherapist and occupational therapists to provide assessment and to recommend additional (controls) strategies to minimise the risk. \nEnsuring the Home has sufficient resources for appropriate manual handling equipment and that there is a regular preventative maintenance and servicing schedule in place.\n\nThe CM has the responsibility:\nFor ensuring protocols are established to ensure Consumers are assessed on admission enabling appropriate controls to be implemented as quickly as possible.\nWhere possible pre-admission assessments are completed so equipment can be allocated pre-admission further reducing the risk because the Home does not have the right equipment.\nTo ensure assessment tools are evidence based and workers are trained appropriately in their application.\n\nRNs have the responsibility for ensuring:\nA manual handling assessment based on the Consumers physical and cognitive health is carried out immediately at the time of admission.\nOngoing assessments are carried out, examining other health outcomes and the relationship they may have on the Consumer’s ability to assist in manual handling techniques.\nAINs are responsible for continuous assessment as they provide care that the appropriate controls are effective and consulting with the RN and physiotherapist if reassessment is required.\nAll workers need to have appropriate knowledge about body movements and the best technique for the Consumer and for their own personal safety.\nThe implementation of manual handling controls is paramount in controlling the risk of injury. \n\nThe Maintenance Officer is responsible:\nFor ensuring preventative maintenance checks and servicing for all lifting equipment is carried out according to the manufacturer’s requirements and the relevant standards\n\nManual handling risk assessments non-Consumer related:\nAll workers are to assessment the risk of lifting and follow the safe manual handling guidelines as per the mandatory training modules.\nEach service area has WSMS for identified manual handling risks.\n\nManual handling Consumer risk assessments:\nPre-admission assessment either direct or indirectly from collecting information from other health professional who have been involved in the Consumer’s care, family members, significant others. Depending on cognitive ability assessments often can be done via the phone.  \nA risk assessment for manual handling is to be carried out for each Consumer by a physiotherapist and/or other appropriately qualified professional, on the Consumer’s admission.  Often the physiotherapist may not be available so the RN will have to carry out the risk assessment.\nReassessment as their condition changes and at minimum every 12 months. Evaluation of the Care and Services Plan at least every three months. \nAll personnel involved in direct Consumer care must understand the required manual handling techniques and the individual needs of the Consumer during movement.\nThere must be a method for simple, clear and precise communication of manual handling technique – this may be in the form of a mini-care plan within the Consumer’s room.\nCommunication systems must be in place to enable prompt professional reassessment, and instruction for workers, when a Consumer’s condition changes and handling risks are increased.\nRisk assessment is to include the following criteria:\nConsumer’s general and weight-bearing abilities.\nThe consistency of these abilities.\nConsumer’s body weight and weight distribution.\nConsumer’s cognitive skills (e.g., ability to understand and cooperate).\nThe consistency/predictability of these skills.\nThe nature of the transfer or position changes required.\nThe Consumer’s general condition (e.g., presence of very frail skin, amputation or other complicating factors).\n\nRisk controls \nManual handling techniques will be prescribed for each Consumer based on the safety considerations arising from the risk assessment. This information will be written into their Care and Service Plans and will be accessible to all workers at all times. \nManual handling techniques and protocols will be prescribed by a physiotherapist or other appropriately qualified professional. \nProtocols will include:\nNumber of workers required to assist the Consumer for each type of transfer and for repositioning in bed.\nAid/s or device/s to be used (e.g., walk-belt, slip sheet or hoist).\nWhether the Consumer can weight bear (e.g., standing transfer) or is unable to sufficiently weight bear (e.g., hoist transfer).\nThe number of workers required to assist walking, how far the Consumer can walk and what aid is to be used.\nAids and equipment for Consumer transfers and handling will be selected and tested in the workplace by a physiotherapist, or other appropriately qualified professionals, prior to their purchase and introduction to the work areas.  \nAll equipment will comply with the required Australian Standards.\nManual handling equipment and aids (including wheels and brakes on wheelchairs, beds, hoists, slings, slip sheets and walk-belts etc.) must be maintained in safe working order and communication systems shall be in place to facilitate the prompt reporting and repair of any defects. \nEffective communication systems will be in place to ensure that workers are informed, on a timely basis, of the current techniques and aids required for each Consumer’s transfer/repositioning.\nGeneral principles of safe manual handling are to be applied to all manual handling activities with Consumers. In addition to the application of these principles, and the use of prescribed techniques and equipment, every effort should be made to gain the Consumer’s cooperation by providing simple explanations and instructions throughout each activity.\nConsumer care areas will be equipped with sufficient numbers of manual handling aids and devices to allow workers easy access to the equipment they require to carry out prescribed techniques.\nWherever practicable, wall rails must be fitted in all Consumer transfer areas.  These rails generally increase the independence of weight bearing Consumers for transfers/mobilisation, therefore decreasing the physical stresses and strains on workers.\nWheelchairs and mobile armchairs reduce the number of transfers required for immobile Consumers. This equipment needs to be accessible within the Home.\nResponsibility shall be delegated, and protocols implemented to ensure that workers have prompt access to special clothing when Consumers become difficult to dress and care for in conventional styles and fabrics. \nThe RN will liaise (as appropriate) with all Allied Health Staff and relatives to try to find solutions where restless behaviour is necessitating frequent adjustments to an immobile Consumer’s positioning in a chair or bed.\nAccess to Consumer care areas should be unobstructed and allow workers adequate room to manoeuvre equipment. \nRNs should allocate workloads fairly amongst workers. \nHealth care workers should, where possible, buddy with another workers member who is of similar height ensuring equipment such as bed height is appropriate for both. \nRisk assessment should include transportation – should a wheel chair taxi be the used to minimise manual handling. \n\nTraining \nManual handling including a competency test will be included at induction and on an annual basis.\nThese sessions will inform and educate workers in delivering care that promotes their own and the Consumer’s safety.\n\nAdministration \nWhere major structural problems are contributing to manual handling injuries, the Leadership Team will address these problems, as far as practicable, as a high priority within financial management structures.\n\n\nTrips, Slips and Falls \nNon-slip surfaces are to be applied in all bathrooms and kitchens.\nCarpets are to be firm and have minimal change in height from non-carpeted areas.\nBarriers and wet floor signs are to be displayed when spills are present or floor mopping is taking place.\nDrying of floors post mopping. \nScheduling of cleaning, especially mopping of bedrooms rooms, service areas and corridors when there is the least about of foot traffic.\nAdequate lighting.\nEdges of steps and ramps will be marked (where needed).\nTalcum powder must not be used in bathrooms. \nBathroom floors are to be mopped as soon as possible after use, and dried to reduce the risk of a slip.\nWorkers must wear non-slip shoes as part of their uniform.\nAll electric cables, medical tubing, nurse call bells, phone cords and computer cables must be secured.\n\n RELATED DOCUMENTS \nBoard reports\nBusiness Continuity Plan\nCare and Services Plan \nChemical Register\nCleaning Schedule \nContinuous Improvement Plan \nContractor Handbook\nCytotoxic Register \nCytotoxic Spill Kit Contents List\nEnvironmental Audit\nHazard Report form \nIncident Form \nIncident Investigation Form \nMaintenance Register \nReactive and Preventative Maintenance Schedules\nWorkforce Incident Register \nVolunteer Handbook\nWHS committee meeting minutes \nWorker Register of Incidents\nREFERENCES \nAged Care Act 1997 (including amendments up to 2019) \nAged Care Quality and Safety Commission 2019    \nAged Care Quality Standards 2019\nANSI/IES RP-29-16 Revised Lighting for Hospitals and Health Care Facilities ISN #978-0-87995-338-6\nAS/NZS 1680.0:2009 Interior lighting - safe movement \nAS/NZS 1680.1:2006 Interior and workplace lighting - Part 1: General principles and recommendations\nAS/NZS 1680.2.5:2018 Interior and workplace Lighting – Part 2.5 Hospital and medical tasks\nAS/NZS 1680.4:2017 Interior and workplace lighting Part 4: maintenance of electrical lighting systems\nAS/NZS 2293.1:2018 Emergency lighting and exit signs for buildings - Part 1: System design, installation and operation\nAS/NZS 2293.3:2018 Emergency lighting and exit signs for buildings - Part 3: Emergency luminaires and exit signs\nAS/NZS 2293.2:1995 Emergency evacuation lighting for buildings - Inspection and maintenance\nAS/NZS 3003:2018 Electrical Installations - Patient Areas\nAS/NZS 3003:2018 Electrical Installations in Patients Areas  \nAS/NZS 3007 Electrical Installations\nAS/NZS 3199: 2007 Approval and test specifications – cord extension sets\nAS/NZS 3760: 2010 - In service safety inspection and testing of electrical equipment\nAS/NZS 5762:2011 Inservice safety and inspection and testing - repaired electrical equipment\\\nBuilding Code of Australia (current version).\nCytotoxic Drugs and Related Waste - Risk Management Guide (SafeWork NSW)\nNSW Govt.

    "content": "Context: ANAAC Assessment in the Australian Aged Care Industry\nThe Australian National Aged Care Classification (ANAAC) Assessment is a standardized framework used in the Australian aged care sector to determine funding allocations for residential aged care providers. It replaced the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) and is designed to align care funding more closely with residents' actual care needs.\nContext and Purpose\nThe ANAAC Assessment was introduced as part of broader aged care reforms to improve transparency and ensure funding reflects residents' complexity and resource requirements.\nIt classifies residents into 13 funding categories based on care needs, including daily living activities, cognitive function, and complex health conditions.\nThis data-driven approach aims to enhance financial sustainability, encourage providers to deliver better care, and reduce manual administrative burden in funding determinations.\nKey Features\nStandardized Assessment Process: Conducted by trained clinicians to ensure consistency.\nNeeds-Based Funding: Replaces the previous subjective model with an objective, evidence-based classification.\nAlignment with Workforce Needs: Helps providers allocate resources efficiently and plan for workforce demands.\nThis assessment framework forms the foundation of funding and operational decisions in aged care, making it critical for any AI-driven assessment or automation tool in this sector. Let me know if you'd like this tailored further for your briefing document.\nAssessment steps \nStandardized ANAAC Assessment Process in Australian Aged Care\nThe ANAAC (Australian National Aged Care Classification) assessment process follows a structured and standardized approach to determine the funding category for each resident in a residential aged care facility. This process ensures consistency, accuracy, and alignment with residents' care needs.\n1. Resident Admission & Initial Screening\nUpon entry into a residential aged care facility, the resident undergoes an initial screening and health review.\nCare staff collect preliminary information on medical history, cognitive function, mobility, and support needs.\n2. Comprehensive Clinical Assessment\nA trained assessor (usually a registered nurse or allied health professional) conducts a standardized ANAAC assessment.\nThe assessment covers three key domains: \nActivities of Daily Living (ADL): Mobility, personal care, feeding assistance.\nCognition & Behaviour: Cognitive impairment, dementia, and behavioral support needs.\nComplex Health Conditions: Wound care, pain management, medical complexity.\n3. Classification into ANAAC Categories\nThe collected data is analyzed to assign the resident to one of 13 ANAAC funding categories.\nEach category corresponds to a specific care funding level, ensuring resources are allocated based on actual needs.\n4. Verification & Quality Assurance\nThe assessment undergoes verification by a second assessor or quality review team to ensure accuracy and compliance.\nThis step prevents over-classification or under-classification, ensuring fair and appropriate funding.\n5. Submission to Government Systems\nThe final classification is submitted to Services Australia’s aged care funding system.\nThe facility receives funding adjustments based on the resident’s assessed needs.\n6. Ongoing Monitoring & Reassessment\nResidents’ conditions are regularly reviewed to capture any changes in care needs.\nIf a resident's health status deteriorates or improves, a reassessment can be triggered to update their funding classification\n\nAssessment classifications – table view\n\n\nAssessment classifications – flow chart / tree view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Documentation Used in ANAAC Assessments\nThe ANAAC (Australian National Aged Care Classification) assessment relies on a range of clinical documentation to ensure accurate classification and funding allocation. This documentation helps assessors evaluate residents' functional abilities, cognitive status, and medical conditions.\n\n1. Resident Health Records & Care Plans\nAdmission & Medical History Records – Includes pre-existing conditions, past medical history, and baseline functional status.\nComprehensive Care Plans – Documents individualized care strategies based on resident needs.\nProgress Notes & Daily Care Logs – Recorded by nursing and care staff to track changes in a resident’s condition.\n2. Standardized Assessment Tools\nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) Assessments\nBarthel Index of ADL – Measures mobility, feeding, bathing, toileting, and dressing capabilities.\nFunctional Independence Measure (FIM) – Evaluates physical and cognitive disability levels.\nCognitive & Behavioral Assessments\nMini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) – Measures cognitive impairment severity.\nPsychogeriatric Assessment Scales (PAS) – Assesses dementia, depression, and behavioral disturbances.\nCohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) – Used for identifying behavioral symptoms in dementia patients.\nComplex Health Needs Assessments\nPain Assessment (Abbey Pain Scale, PAINAD for dementia residents) – Evaluates pain levels in non-verbal patients.\nPressure Injury Risk Assessments (Braden Scale, Waterlow Score) – Identifies residents at risk of pressure sores.\nFalls Risk Assessments (Morse Falls Scale, FRAT) – Determines likelihood of falls and injury risk.\nMedication Charts & Administration Records – Tracks prescribed medications, high-risk medications (e.g., insulin, anticoagulants).\n3. Nursing & Allied Health Reports\nPhysiotherapy & Occupational Therapy Reports – Evaluates mobility, rehabilitation needs, and assistive device requirements.\nSpeech Pathology & Swallowing Assessments – Used for residents with dysphagia (swallowing difficulties).\nDietitian Assessments & Nutritional Plans – Assesses malnutrition risk and dietary requirements.\n4. Clinical Monitoring & Specialist Reports\nVital Signs & Chronic Disease Monitoring Records – Includes BP, glucose levels, oxygen saturation.\nWound Management Documentation – Tracks healing progress, dressing changes, and wound care plans.\nSpecialist Medical Reports (Neurology, Geriatrics, Palliative Care) – Provides additional insights for complex cases.\n5. ANAAC-Specific Classification Documentation\nOfficial ANAAC Assessment Form – Standardized template completed by assessors, including scoring criteria for ADL, cognition, and complex care needs.\nFunding Category Determination Report – Generated after assessment, summarizing the resident’s classification and justification.\n\nAssessment approach for these documents\nHow Clinical Staff Analyze and Interpret ANAAC Assessment Documentation\nClinical staff—including registered nurses (RNs), allied health professionals, and aged care assessors—use a structured methodology to interpret assessment documents and apply the ANAAC classification system accurately. This process ensures consistency, accuracy, and compliance with funding guidelines.\n\n1. Training & Standardized Guidelines\nClinical staff are trained using ANAAC assessment manuals provided by Services Australia.\nGuidelines outline:\nScoring methodologies for each assessment domain (ADL, cognition, complex health needs).\nInterpretation rules for standardized assessment tools (e.g., MMSE for cognition, Barthel Index for ADL).\nUse of clinical judgment to contextualize a resident’s condition beyond raw scores.\n\n2. Step-by-Step Document Analysis Process\nClinical staff follow a structured approach to extract relevant information from clinical documents:\nStep 1: Gather & Review Key Documents\nResident care plan & progress notes: Identify recent changes in condition.\nADL, cognition, and health assessments: Locate standardized assessment results.\nNursing & allied health reports: Cross-check medical dependencies.\nStep 2: Identify Key Indicators for Each ANAAC Domain\nADL Dependency Analysis\nReview Barthel Index, FIM scores for functional ability.\nCorrelate with physiotherapy & occupational therapy reports (e.g., mobility aid requirements).\nAssess trends in progress notes (e.g., increasing assistance needed for bathing, dressing).\nCognitive & Behavioral Assessment\nInterpret MMSE or PAS scores for dementia classification.\nCross-check CMAI behavioral assessments for agitation/aggression.\nVerify consistency with neurology/geriatrician reports.\nComplex Health Needs Review\nExtract pain levels from Abbey Pain Scale or PAINAD scores.\nReview wound care reports, medication charts, and hospital discharge summaries for chronic conditions.\nConsult vital signs monitoring logs for trends in health deterioration.\n\nStep 3: Apply ANAAC Classification Logic\nCompare findings against ANAAC scoring thresholds.\nAllocate a provisional category based on combined ADL, cognition, and health needs data.\nUse multidisciplinary review (e.g., consulting senior nurses, allied health professionals) for borderline cases.\n\nStep 4: Verify & Cross-Check\nEnsure consistency with previous assessments to detect progression or deterioration.\nConduct peer review or secondary assessment for high-complexity cases.\nFinalize and document assessment in the official ANAAC form.\n\nCurrent approach\n\nThe current design approach utilises a Multi Agent Model that: \nIngests the available set of input documentation form the source system (extraction pipeline has been run for the resident and full extracted data set is uploaded to S3 bucket in structured folder format)\nChunks ingested data set and obtains only required data for analysis\nFollows the structured analysis approach in the order defined by data / assessment logic / mapping\napplies the analysis logic defined by the Mirus clinical team to derive a score for each assessment domain. \nOnce the first round of analysis has been completed consensus agent reviews the outcomes to consolidate the different analysis outcomes into a unified classification. \nLogic for consensus has also been defined by the team analysis, assessment result and supporting evidence are saved. \nThe UI outlines each of the results, provides supporting evidence and allows review feedback to be collected against each analysis.\nCustom UI allows to review, comment and print Assessment Journey by resident.\n\nSystem components \n\nRPA Extraction Pipeline for ICARE\nS3 Bucket for Input Storage\nAI engine for data analysis and prediction\nEnd user interface for review of outcome and evidence and feedback \n\n\n\nData Mapping and Assessment Logic\n\nReview Step 1: Analysis for Example Bed Role in Mobility\n\n\n\n\nReview Step 2: Consensus for Example Bed Role in Mobility\n\n\nBriefing & Key Questions"

童年\n\n我们从一份档案开始。\n\n姓名：朱元璋别名（外号）：朱重八、朱国瑞\n\n性别：男\n\n民族：汉\n\n血型：？\n\n学历：无文凭，秀才举人进士统统的不是，后曾自学过\n\n职业：皇帝\n\n家庭出身：（至少三代）贫农\n\n生卒：1328－1398\n\n最喜欢的颜色：黄色（这个好像没得选）\n\n社会关系：\n\n父亲：朱五四，农民\n\n母亲：陈氏，农民（不好意思，史书中好像没有她的名字）\n\n座右铭：你的就是我的，我还是我的\n\n主要经历：\n\n1328年－1344年放牛\n\n1344年－1347年做和尚，主要工作是出去讨饭（这个……）\n\n1347年－1352年做和尚主要工作是撞钟\n\n1352年－1368年造反（这个猛）\n\n1368年－1398年主要工作是做皇帝\n\n一切的事情都从1328年的那个夜晚开始，农民朱五四的妻子陈氏生下了一个男婴，大家都知道了，这个男婴就是后来的朱元璋。大凡皇帝出世，后来的史书上都会有一些类似的怪象记载。\n\n比如刮风啊，下暴雨啊，冒香气啊，天上星星闪啊，到处放红光啊，反正就是要告诉你，这个人和别人不一样。朱元璋先生也不例外，他出生时，红光满地，夜间房屋中出现异光，以致于邻居以为失火了，跑来相救（明实录）。\n\n然而当时农民朱五四的心情并不像今天我们在医院产房外看到的那些焦急中带着喜悦的父亲们，作为已经有了三个儿子、两个女儿的父亲而言，首先要考虑的是吃饭问题。\n\n农民朱五四的工作由两部分构成，他有一个豆腐店，但主要还是要靠种地主家的土地讨生活，这就决定了作为这个劳动家庭的一员，要活下去只能不停的干活。\n\n在小朱五四出生一个月后，父母为他取了一个名字（元时惯例）：朱重八，这个名字也可以叫做朱八八，我们这里再介绍一下，朱重八家族的名字，都很有特点。\n\n朱重八高祖名字：朱百六；\n\n朱重八曾祖名字：朱四九；\n\n朱重八祖父名字：朱初一；\n\n他的父亲我们介绍过了，叫朱五四。\n\n取这样的名字不是因为朱家是搞数学的，而是因为在元朝，老百姓如果不能上学和当官就没有名字，只能以父母年龄相加或者出生的日期命名。（登记户口的人一定会眼花）\n\n朱重八的童年在一间冬凉夏暖、四面通风、采光良好的破茅草屋里度过，他的主要工作是为地主刘德家放牛。他曾经很想读书，可是朱五四是付不起学费的，他没有李密牛角挂书那样的情操，自然也没有杨素那样的大官来赏识他，于是，他很老实的帮刘德放了十二年的牛。\n\n因为，他要吃饭。\n\n在此时，朱重八的梦想是好好的活下去，到十六岁的时候，托村口的吴老太作媒，找一个手脚勤快、能干活的姑娘当媳妇，然后生下自己的儿女，儿女的名字可能是朱三二、或者朱四零，等到朱三二等人大了，就让他们去地主刘小德家放牛。\n\n这就是十六岁时的朱重八对未来生活的幸福向往。\n\n此时的中国，正在极其腐败的元王朝的统治下，那些来自蒙古的征服者似乎不认为在自己统治下的老百姓是人，他们甚至经常考虑把这些占地方的家伙都杀掉，然后把土地用来放牧（元史），从赋税到徭役，只要是人能想出来的科目，都能用来收钱，过节要收“过节钱”、干活有“常例钱”、打官司有“公事钱”，怕了吧，那我不出去还不行吗？不干事还不行吗？那也不行，平白无故也要钱，要收“撒花钱”。服了吧。\n\n于是，在这个马上民族统治中国六十余年后，他们的国家机器已经到了无法承受的地步，此时的元帝国就好像是一匹不堪重负的骆驼，只等那最后一根稻草。\n\n这根稻草很快就到了。\n\n1344年是一个有特殊意义的年份，在这一年，上天终于准备抛弃元了，他给中国带来了两个灾难，同时也给元挖了一个墓坑，并写好了墓志铭：石人一只眼，挑动黄河天下反。\n\n他想的很周到，还为元准备了一个填土的人：朱重八。\n\n当然朱重八不会想到上天会交给他这样一个重要的任务。\n\n这一年，他十七岁。\n\n很快一场灾难就要降临到他的身上，但同时，一个伟大的事业也在等待着他，只有像传说中的凤凰一样，历经苦难，投入火中，经过千锤百炼，才能浴火重生，成为光芒万丈的神鸟。\n\n朱重八，来吧，命运之神正在等待着你！\n\n第二章 灾难\n\n元至正四年（公元1344年）到来了，这一年刚开始，元帝国的头头脑脑们就收到了两个消息，首先是黄河泛滥了，沿岸山东河南几十万人沦为难民。即使不把老百姓当人，但还要防着他们造反，所以修黄河河堤就成为了必须要做的事情。\n\n可是令人意外的是，在元的政府中，竟然出现了两种不同的意见，一种认为一定要修，另一种认为不能修。在现在看来，这似乎是不可思议的事情，黄河泛滥居然不去修，难道要任黄河改道淹死那么多人？在中国历史上有着太多不可思议的事情，这个也不例外。\n\n客观的讲，在这样一件事上，就维护元朝的统治而言，主要修的不一定是忠臣，反对修的也未必就是奸臣，其中奥妙何处？要到七年后才会见分晓。\n\n极力主张修的是元朝的著名宰相脱脱，他可以说是元朝的最后一个名臣，实行了很多的改革政策，为政清廉，而且十分能干（宋史就是他主持修的），可是他没有想到的是，他的极力主张，已经给元朝埋下了一个大大的炸药包，拉好了引线，只等着那微弱的火光。\n\n另一个是淮河沿岸遭遇严重瘟疫和旱灾，对于元政府来说，这个比较简单一点，反正饿死病死了就没麻烦了，当然表面功夫还是要做的，皇帝（元顺帝）要下诏赈灾，中书省的高级官员们要联系粮食和银两，当然了自己趁机拿一点也是可以理解的。赈灾物品拨到各路（元代地方行政单位），地方长官们再留下点，之后是州、县。一层一层下来，到老百姓手中就剩谷壳了。然后地方上的各级官员们上书向皇帝表示感谢，照例也要说些感谢天恩的话，并把历史上的尧舜禹汤与皇上比较一下，皇帝看到了报告，深感自己做了大好事，于是就在自己的心中给自己记上一笔。\n\n皆大欢喜，皆大欢喜，大家都很满意。\n\n但老百姓是不满意的，很多人都不满意。\n\n朱重八肯定是那些极其不满意的人中的一个。\n\n灾难到来后，四月初六朱重八的父亲饿死，初九大哥饿死，十二日，大哥长子饿死、二十二日，母亲饿死。\n\n如果说这是日记的话，那应该是世界上最悲惨的日记之一。\n\n朱重八的愿望并不过分，他只是想要一个家，想要自己的子女，想要给辛劳一生，从没欺负过别人，老实巴交的父母一个安详的晚年，起码有口饭吃。\n\n他的家虽然不大，但家庭成员关系和睦，相互依靠，父母虽然贫穷，但每天下地干活回来仍然会带给重八惊喜，有时是一个小巧的竹蜻蜓，有时是地主家不吃的猪头肉，这就是朱重八的家，然而现在什么都没有了。\n\n朱重八的姐姐已经出嫁，三哥去了倒插门。除了朱重八的二哥，这个家庭已经没有了其他成员。\n\n十七岁的朱重八，眼睁睁的看着他的亲人一个一个死去，而他却无能为力。人世间最大的痛苦莫过于此！\n\n他唯一的宣泄方式是痛哭，可是哭完了，他还要面对一个重要的问题，要埋葬他的父母，可是没有棺材、没有寿衣、没有坟地，他只能去找地主刘德，求刘德看在父亲给他当了一辈子佃户的分上，找个地方埋了他爹。\n\n刘德干净利落的拒绝了他，原因简单，你父母死了，关我何事，给我干活，我也给过他饭吃。\n\n朱重八没有办法，只能和他的二哥用草席盖着亲人的尸体，然后拿门板抬着到处走，希望能够找到一个地方埋葬父母。可是天下虽大，到处都是土地，却没有一块是属于他们的。\n\n幸好有好心人看到他们确实可怜，终于给了他们一块地方埋葬父母。“魂悠悠而觅父母无有，志落魄而泱佯”，这是后来能吃饱饭的朱元璋的情感回忆。\n\n朱重八不明白，自己的父母在土地上耕作了一辈子，却在死后连入土为安都做不到。地主从来不种地，却衣食无忧。为什么？可他此时也无法思考这个问题，因为他也要吃饭，他要活下去。\n\n在绝望的时候，朱重八不止一次的祈求上天，从道教的太上老君到佛教的如来佛祖，只要他能知道名字的，祈祷的唯一内容只是希望与父母在一起生活下去，有口饭吃。\n\n但结果让他很失望，于是他那幼小的心灵开始变得冰冷，他知道没有人能救他，除了他自己。\n\n复仇的火焰开始在他心底燃烧。\n\n如此的痛苦，使他从脆弱到坚强。\n\n为了有饭吃，他决定去当和尚。\n\n【和尚的生涯】\n\n朱重八选择的地方是附近的皇觉寺，在寺里，他从事着类似长工的工作，他突然发现那些和尚除了没有头发，对待他的态度比刘德好不了多少，这些和尚自己有田地，还能结婚（元代），如果钱多还可以去开当铺。\n\n但他们也需要人给他们打杂，在那里的和尚不念经，不拜佛，甚至连佛祖金身也不擦，这些活自然而然的由刚进庙的新人朱重八来完成。\n\n朱重八一直忍耐着，然而除了要做这些粗活外，他还要兼任清洁工，仓库保管员，添油工（长明灯）。即使这样，他还是经常挨骂，在那些和尚喝酒吃肉的时候，他还要擦洗香客踩踏的地板，每一个孤独的夜晚，他只能独坐在柴房中，看着窗外的天空，思念着只与自己相处了十余年的父母。\n\n他已经很知足了，他能吃饱饭，这就够了，不是吗？\n\n然而命运似乎要锻炼他的意志，他入寺仅五十余天后，由于饥荒过于严重，所有的和尚都要出去化缘，所谓化缘就是讨饭，我们熟悉的唐僧同志每次的口头禅就是：悟空，你去化些斋来。用俗话来说就是，悟空，你去讨点饭来。我曾经考察过化缘这个问题，发现朱重八同志连化缘也被人欺负。由于和尚多，往往对化缘地有界定，哪些地方富点，就指派领导的亲戚去，那些地方穷，就安排朱重八同志去。\n\n反正饿死也该，谁让你是朱重八。\n\n朱重八被指派的地点是在淮西和河南。这里也是饥荒的主要地带，谁能化给他呢？\n\n然而，就从这里开始，命运之神向他微笑。\n\n在游方的生活中，朱重八只能走路，没有顺风车可搭，是名副其实的驴行。他一边走，一边讨饭，穿城越村，挨家挨户，山栖露宿，每敲开一扇门，对他都是一种考验，因为面对他的往往只是白眼、冷嘲热讽，对朱重八来说，敲开那扇门可能意味着侮辱，但不敲那扇门就会饿死。\n\n朱重八已经没有了父母，没有了家，他所有的只是那么一点可怜的自尊，然而讨饭的生活使他失去了最后的保护。要讨饭就不能有尊严。\n\n生命的尊严和生存的压力，哪个更重要？\n\n是的，朱重八，只有失去一切，你才能明白自己的力量和伟大。\n\n朱重八和别的乞丐不同，也正是因为不同，他才没有一直当乞丐（请注意这句话）。\n\n在讨饭的时候，他仔细研究了淮西的地理、山脉、风土人情，他开阔了视野，丰富了见识，认识了很多豪杰（实际上也是讨饭者）。此时，他还有了自己的宗教信仰——明教，他相信当黑暗笼罩大地的时候，伟大的弥勒佛一定会降世的。其实就他的身世遭遇来说，他是不是真的相信弥勒倒是很难说的，我们有理由相信，他心中真正的弥勒是他自己。\n\n但朱重八最重要的收获是：他已经从一个只能无助的看着父母死去的孩童，一个被人欺负后只能躲在柴堆里小声哭的杂役，变成了能坚强面对一切困难的战士。一个武装到心灵的战士。\n\n长期的困难生活，最能磨练一个人的意志，有很多人在遇到困难后，只能怨天尤人，得过且过，而另外一些人虽然也不得不在困难面前低头，但他们的心从未屈服，他们不断的努力，相信一定能够取得最后的胜利。\n\n朱重八毫无疑问是后一种。\n\n如果说，在出来讨饭前，他还是一个不知所措的少年，在他经过三年漂泊的生活回到皇觉寺时，他已经是一个有自信战胜一切的人。\n\n这是一个伟大的转变，很多人可能究其一辈子也无法完成。转变的关键在于心。\n\n对于我们很多人来说，心是最柔弱的地方，它特别容易被伤害，爱情的背叛，亲情的失去，友情的丢失，都将是重重的一击。然而对于朱重八来说，还有什么不可承受的呢？他已经失去一切，还有什么比亲眼看着父母死去而无能为力，为了活下去和狗抢饭吃、被人唾骂，鄙视更让人痛苦！我们有理由相信，就在某一个痛苦思考的夜晚，朱重八把这个最脆弱的地方变成了最强大的力量的来源。\n\n是的，即使你拥有人人羡慕的容貌，博览群书的才学，挥之不尽的财富，也不能证明你的强大，因为心的强大，才是真正的强大。\n\n当朱重八准备离开自己讨饭的淮西，回到皇觉寺时，他仔细的回忆了这个他呆了三年的地方，思考了他在这里得到的和失去的，然后收拾自己的包裹踏上了回家的路。\n\n也许我还会回来的，朱重八这样想。\n\n第三章 踏上征途\n\n至正十一年（公元1351年），上天给元朝的最后一根稻草终于压了下来，元朝的末日到了。\n\n我们的谜底也揭开了，现在看来，脱脱坚决要求治黄河的愿望是好的，然而他不懂得那些反对的人的苦心，元朝那腐败到极点的官吏也是他所不了解的。现在他终于要尝到苦果了。\n\n当元朝命令沿岸十七万劳工修河堤时，各级的官吏也异常兴奋，首先，皇帝拨给的修河工钱是可以克扣的，民工的口粮是可以克扣的，反正他们不吃不喝也事不关己。这就是一大笔收入，工程的费用也是可以克扣的，反正黄河泛滥也淹不死自己这些当官的。\n\n这是管河务的，那么不管河务的怎么捞钱呢，其实也简单，既然这么大工程，必然有徭役指标，找几十个人，到各个乡村去，看到男人就带走，理由？修河堤，不想去？拿钱来。\n\n没有钱？有什么值钱的都带走！\n\n可怜的脱脱，一个好的理论家，却不是一个实践家。\n\n老把戏出场了，当民工们挖到山东时，他们从河道下挖出了一个一只眼睛石人，背部刻着石人一只眼，挑动黄河天下反。民工们突然发现，这正是他们在工地上传唱了几年的歌词。于是人心思动。\n\n这真是老把戏，简直可以编成电脑程序，在起义之前总要搞点这种封建迷信，但也没办法，人家就吃这一套。\n\n接着的事情似乎就是理所应当的了，几天后，在朱重八讨过饭的地方（颖州，今安徽阜阳），韩山童和刘福通起义了，他们的起义与以往起义并没有不同，照例要搞个宗教组织，这次是白莲教，当然既然敢起义，身份也应该有所不同，于是，可能是八辈子贫农的韩山童突然姓了赵，成了宋朝的皇室，刘福通也成了刘光世大将的后人。\n\n他们的命运和以往第一个起义的农民领袖也类似，起义、被镇压、后来者居上，这似乎是陈胜吴广们的宿命。\n\n尽管他们的起义形式毫无新意，但这并不妨碍他们的伟大和在历史上的地位，在史书上，将永远的纪录着：公元1351年，韩山童、刘福通第一个举起了反抗元朝封建统治的大旗。\n\n自古以来，建立一个王朝很难，毁灭一个却相对容易得多，所谓墙倒众人推，破鼓万人捶，不是没有来由的。\n\n在元代这个把人分为四个等级的朝代里，最高等级的蒙古人杀掉最低等级的南人，唯一的惩罚是赔偿一头驴，碰到个闲散民工之类的人，可能连驴都省了。蒙古贵族们的思维似乎很奇怪，他们即使在占据了中国后，好像仍然把自己当成客人，主人家的东西想抢就抢，想拿就拿，反正不关自己的事。在他们的思维中，这些南人只会忍受也只能忍受他们的折磨。\n\n但他们错了，这些奴隶会起来反抗的，当愤怒和不满超过了限度，当连像狗一样生存下去都成为一种奢望的时候，反抗是唯一的道路。反抗是为了生存。\n\n这把火终于烧起来了，而且是燎原之势。\n\n在短短的一年时间里，看似强大的元帝国发生了几十起暴动，数百万人参加了起义军，即使那纵横天下无敌手的蒙古骑兵也不复当年之勇，无力拯救危局。元帝国就像一堵朽墙，只要再踢一脚，就会倒下来。\n\n此时的朱重八却仍然在寺庙里撞着钟，从种种迹象看，他并没有参加起义军的企图。虽然他与元朝有着不共戴天的仇恨，但对于一个普通人朱重八来说，起义是要冒风险的，捉住后是要杀头的，这使得他不得不仔细的考虑。\n\n在很多的书中，朱重八被塑造成一个天生英雄的形象，于是在这样的剧本里，天生英雄的朱重八一听说起义了，马上回寺庙里操起家伙就投奔了起义军，表现了他彻底的革命性等等。\n\n我认为，这不是真实的朱重八。\n\n作为一个正常人，在做出一个可能会掉脑袋的决定的选择上，是绝对不会如此轻率的，如果朱重八真的是这样莽撞的一个人，他就不是一个真正的英雄。\n\n真正的朱重八是一个有畏惧心理的人，他遭受过极大的痛苦，对元有着刻骨的仇恨，但他也知道生的可贵，一旦选择了造反，就没有回头路。\n\n知道可能面对的困难和痛苦，在死亡的恐惧中不断挣扎，而仍然能战胜自己，选择这条道路，才是真正的勇气。\n\n我认为这样的朱重八才是真正的英雄，一个战胜自己，不畏惧死亡的英雄。\n\n朱重八在庙里的生活是枯燥而有规律的，但这枯燥而规律的生活被起义的熊熊烈火打乱了。具有讽刺意义的是，具体打乱这一切的并不是起义军，而是那些元的官吏们。\n\n在镇压起义军的战斗中，如果吃了败仗，是要被上司处罚的，但镇压起义的任务又是必须要完成的，于是元朝的官吏们毅然决然的决定，拿老百姓开刀，既然无法打败起义军，那就把那些可以欺负的老百姓抓去交差，把他们当起义军杀掉。\n\n从这个角度来看，元的腐朽官吏为推翻元朝的统治实在是不遗余力，立了大功。\n\n此时摆在朱重八面前的形势严重了，如果不去起义，很有可能被某一个官吏抓去当起义者杀掉，然后冠以张三或者李四的名字。但投奔起义军也有很大的风险，一旦被元军打败，也是性命难保。\n\n就在此时，一封信彻底改变了他的命运。\n\n他幼年时候的朋友汤和写了一封信给他，信的内容是自己做了起义军的千户，希望朱重八也来参加起义军，共图富贵，朱重八看过后，不动声色，将信烧掉了。他还没有去参加起义的心理准备。\n\n然而晚上，他的师兄告诉他，有人已经知道了他看义军信件的事情，准备去告发他。\n\n朱重八终于被逼上了绝路。\n\n接下来的是痛苦的思考和抉择朱重八面前有三条路：一、守在寺庙里；二、逃跑；三、造反。\n\n朱重八也拿不定主意，他找到了一个人，问他的意见，这个人叫周德兴，我们后面还要经常提到他。\n\n周德兴似乎也没有什么好主意，他给朱重八的建议是算一卦（这是什么主意），看什么条路合适。\n\n算卦的结果是“卜逃卜守则不吉，将就凶而不妨”，意思是逃跑，呆在这里都不吉利，去造反还可能没事。\n\n朱重八明白自己已经没有退路了，自己不过想要老老实实的过日子，种两亩地，孝敬父母，却做不到，父母负担着沉重的田赋和徭役，没有一天不是勤勤恳恳的干活，还落得个家破人亡的下场。躲到寺庙里不过想混口饭吃，如今又被人告发，可能要掉脑袋。\n\n忍无可忍。\n\n那就反了吧！反他娘的！\n\n这是一个真实版本的逼上梁山，也是那封建时代贫苦农民的唯一选择。谁不珍惜自己的生命？谁愿意打仗？在活不下去时，那些农民被迫以自己的鲜血和生命去推动封建社会的发展，直至它的灭亡。\n\n这是他们的宿命。\n\n所以我认为中国历史上的农民起义确实是值得肯定的，他们也许不是那么厚道，他们也许有着自己的各种打算，但他们确实别无选择。\n\n汤和就这样成了朱重八的第一个战友。他在今后的日子里将陪同朱重八一起走完这条艰苦的道路。\n\n然而汤和也绝对不会想到，自己居然是唯一一个陪他走完这条路的人。\n\n第四章 就从这里起步\n\n至正十二年（公元1352年），濠州城。\n\n城池的守卫者郭子兴正在他的元帅府里，苦苦思索着对策，濠州城已经被元军围了很久，这样下去是坚守不了多久了。\n\n就在此时，手下的军士前来报告，抓住了一个奸细，要请令旗去杀人，如果是以往，郭子兴是不会过问的，让士兵直接拿了令旗去杀就是了，但今天，他开口问了一句：“你怎么知道那个人是奸细？”军士回答道：“这个人说是来投军的，现在元军围困，哪里还有人来投军，他一定是元军奸细。”\n\n郭子兴差点笑了出来，投军？元军快打进城来了，还有来投军的，这个借口可是真不高明，他不禁起了好奇心，想去看看这个奸细。\n\n于是他骑马赶到了城门口，看见了一个相貌奇怪的人，用今天的话来说，这个人的相貌是地包天，下巴突出，更奇特的是，他的额头也是向前凸出的，具体形状大概类似独门兵器月牙铲，上下凸，中间凹（参见朱元璋同志画像）。\n\n这个人当然就是我们的朱重八。\n\n郭子兴走到朱重八的面前，让人松开绑，问他：“你是奸细么？来干什么？”\n\n朱重八平静的回答：“我不是奸细，我是来投军的。”\n\n郭子兴大笑：“什么时候了，还有人来投军，你不用狡辩，等会就把你拉出去杀头！”\n\n朱重八只是应了一声：“喔。”\n\n郭子兴看着朱重八的眼睛，希望能看到慌乱，这是他平时的乐趣之一。\n\n但在这个人眼睛里，他看到的只有镇定。\n\n郭子兴不敢小看这个人了，很明显，这是一个吓不倒的人。于是他认真的询问了朱重八的名字，来历，当朱重八说出是千户长汤和介绍他来时，郭子兴这才明白，这个人真的是来投军的。\n\n朱重八给他的印象实在是太深了，于是他没有将朱重八编入汤和的部队，而是将他放在自己身边，当自己的亲兵（警卫员）。\n\n在军队里，朱重八很快就表现出了他的才能，比起其他的农民兵士，他是一个很突出的人，不但作战勇敢，而且很有计谋，处事冷静，思虑深远（注意这个特点），而且很讲义气，有危险的时候第一个上，这一切都让他有了崇高的威信。加上他的同乡汤和帮忙，他在当士兵两个月后，被提拔为九人长，这是他的第一个官职。\n\n作为郭子兴的亲兵长，朱重八是很称职的，他不像其他的士兵，从不贪图财物，每次得到战利品，就献给郭子兴，如果得到赏赐，就分给士兵，由于他很有天赋，自学过一些字，分析问题准确，郭子兴渐渐把他当成自己的智囊，朱重八在军中的地位也逐渐重要起来。\n\n也就在此时，朱重八将他的名字改成了朱元璋，所谓璋，是一种尖锐的玉器，这个朱元璋实际上就是诛元璋，朱重八把他自己比成诛灭元朝的利器，而这一利器正是元朝的统治者自己铸造出来的。在今后的二十年里，他们都将畏惧这个名字。\n\n【汤和】\n\n在军队中，汤和算是个奇特的人，他在朱元璋刚参军时，已经是千户，但他却很尊敬朱元璋，在军营里，人们可以看到一个奇特的现象，官职高得多的汤和总是走在士兵朱元璋的后边，并且毫不在意他人的眼神，更奇特的是朱元璋似乎认为这是理所应当的事情，也没有推托过。\n\n我们不得不佩服汤和的远见，他知道朱元璋远非池中物，用今天的话说，他很识实务。相信也正是这个优点，使得他能够在后来的腥风血雨中幸存下来。\n\n在军队里，朱元璋娶了老婆，与后来的那些众多妃嫔相比，这个老婆可以算是朱元璋成功的关键因素之一。这个女孩是郭子兴的义女，她的父亲姓马，是郭子兴的朋友，后来死去，将这个女孩托付给郭子兴，女孩名字不详，军队里的人都叫她马姑娘。就这样，朱元璋成了元帅的女婿，而郭子兴则多了一个帮手。\n\n我们可以想象到朱元璋喜悦的心情，他终于有了一个自己的家，不再是那个没人管、没人问的朱重八，他饿了，有人做饭给他吃，冷了，有人送衣服给他，有家的感觉真好。这种感情一直陪伴了他很多年。\n\n此时，朱元璋已经升任了军队中的总管，这个职位大致相当于起义军的办公室主任，他干得不错，对于某些喜欢贪公家便宜，胡乱报销的人，朱元璋是讲原则的，由于他严于律己，大家也没有什么话说，如果就这么干下去，他可能会成为一个优秀的财务管理人员。可是上天偏偏不让他舒服的过下去，不久的将来，他将面对更大的麻烦。\n\n主要问题是，郭子兴的成分问题，他并不是农民，而是地主（想不通他怎么会起义），当时在濠州的统帅除了郭子兴外，还有四个人，以孙德崖为首，而这四个人都是农民，他们和郭子兴之间存在着深刻的矛盾。\n\n不久，矛盾爆发了，一天郭子兴在濠州城里逛街，突然被一群来路不明的人绑票，这些人似乎对索取酬金之类也没有什么兴趣，把郭子兴死打一顿，然后关了禁闭。朱元璋得到消息，大吃一惊，立刻赶去孙德崖家里要人，孙德崖开始还装傻，表情惊讶，要出去找郭子兴，并且说了一些与绑架者不共戴天之类的话，充分表现出了一个业余演员的演技。\n\n朱元璋只把参与打人的军士带到孙德崖面前，并且告诉孙，你的那些贪污公款、胡乱报销的烂账都在我这里，自己看着办。\n\n于是，朱元璋从孙家的地窖中将已经打得半死的郭子兴救了出来，这件事情让朱元璋意识到，跟着这些人不会有前途。\n\n而郭子兴也越来越讨厌朱元璋，原因很简单，朱元璋比他强，对于郭子兴这样一个性情暴躁、不能容人的统帅来说，他是不能容忍一个可能取代他地位的人在身边的。终于有一天，他把朱元璋关了起来，落井下石一向是某些人的优良传统，郭子兴的儿子就是某些人中的一个。他吩咐守兵不能给朱元璋送饭，想要把朱元璋饿死，善良的马姑娘为了救朱元璋，便把刚烫好的烙饼揣在怀中，到牢中探望朱元璋时送给他吃，每次胸口都会烫伤，但每次都送。\n\n有妻如此，夫复何求。\n\n郭子兴毕竟还是不想杀朱元璋，于是将他放了出来，朱元璋经历此事后，终于下了决心，和这些鼠目寸光的人决裂。他向郭子兴申请带兵出征，郭子兴高兴的答应了。\n\n这就是朱元璋霸业的开始，一旦开始，就不会停止。\n\n就从这里起步吧！\n\n朱元璋奉命带兵攻击郭子兴的老家，定远，从这一点可以看出他的岳父实在存心不良，当时的定远有重兵看守，估计郭子兴让他去就是不想再看到活着的朱元璋，但朱元璋就是朱元璋，他找到了元军的一个缝隙，攻克了定远，然后在元军回援前撤出，此后，连续攻击怀远、安奉、含山、虹县，四战四胜，锐不可当！\n\n在召集（也可能是抢）了壮丁后，朱元璋来到了钟离（今安徽凤阳东面），这是他的家乡，在这里他遇到了二十四个来朱元璋队伍里找工作的人。\n\n朱元璋经理招收的二十四个人素质是相当高的，这其中有为他算过命的周德兴，还有堪称天下第一名将的徐达。\n\n这些人还有亲戚，一传十，十传百，什么叔叔、舅舅、子侄、外甥都来了，很快，他的部队（直属）就有了七百人。\n\n当朱元璋再次回到濠州的时候，他已经完全明白了自己的前途所在，所以他向郭子兴辞职，郭子兴非常高兴，这个讨厌的人终于可以走得远远的了。\n\n朱元璋在出发前，又做了一件出人意料的事，他从自己的七百人中重新挑选了二十四个人，然后将其余的人都给了郭子兴，郭子兴多少有些意外，但仍然高兴的接受了。\n\n朱元璋的这个行动似乎可以定义为一次挑选公务员的工作，比例是三十比一，没有笔试，考官就是朱元璋和他的眼光。\n\n他挑的确实很准，看看这些人的名字：徐达、汤和、周德兴，这二十四个人后来都成为了明王朝的高级干部。\n\n唐时的黄巢在考试落榜后，站在长安城门前，惆怅之余，豪气丛生，作诗一首，大大的有名——《咏菊》：\n\n〖待得秋来九月八，我花开时百花杀。\n\n冲天香阵透长安，满城尽带黄金甲。〗\n\n数年后，他带领着十余万大军，打进长安。\n\n此时的朱元璋，站在濠州的城门前，看着自己身后的二十四个人，他知道，迈出这一步，他就将孤军奋战，或者兵败身死，或者开创霸业。\n\n他仰望天空，还是那样阴暗，这个时候作出这个选择，似乎并不吉利，他又想起了那次无奈的占卜。\n\n父母去世的时候，在庙里干苦力的时候，夜里望天痛哭的时候，也是这样的天空。\n\n什么都没有变，变的只是我而已。\n\n〖百花发时我不发，我若发时都吓杀。\n\n要与西风战一场，遍身穿就黄金甲。〗\n\n什么都不能阻挡我，就从这里开始吧！\n\n出发！"
